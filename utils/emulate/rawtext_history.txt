in any case, the article you linked says a K2200 and a GTX750 Ti are roughly performance equivalent for gaming... the former costs $430 and the latter $120.
Sorry, lets 3D print a Graphics Card jukebox. A robot arms comes out and plugs in a new graphics card while software suddenly reboots with the new drivers.
yeah woody, old man got no imagination no more.
not with that attitude woody.
but in persepctive though, im going to get a new laptop from new work, so i dont need to make my home one do CAD.
Andy: no.
https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Can-you-game-on-an-NVIDIA-Quadro-GPU-604/.
my research says they are basically the same.
could you rig up some kind of duel graphics card thing, where you can switch?.
my research says no.
and there are none that do both?.
my research says that CAD graphics cards excel at crunching numbers, where gaming ones excel at spitting out images at 60 frames per second.
or is there something that gaming graphics cards have that's special?.
so wouldn't getting a CAD graphics card be good enough for gaming?.
my research says better drivers and different performance requirements.
nice*.
I think CAD graphics cards are just super fucking ncie.

And she'll say, "You're so full of hot air; you wouldn't even know how to operate a hot air balloon".
by that logic you should drive her around in an ice truck.
Here you go: buy a hot air balloon. "Baby you're so hot there's no other reasonable form of transportation".
This logic fucks .

Ariana Grande seems like a tiny last. Why is she Ariana Grande, not Ariana Tall?.
You son of a bitch..
I wouldn't think of her.
But she'd always wonder and think about me sometimes on rainy days.
She'd say no and we'd go our separate ways.
I'd say "hey my friend is a huge fan can I take a selfie with you to send to him?".
If I got in the same room as Ariana, I'd give her a photo album of me in various turtlenecks.
Batting .500, sUN.
Rich Homie Jon, you a gay fish.
Fishsticks.

Sausage? .
But Jon doesn't even have any money.
Buy VIP tickets to a concert .
Possibly a single letter. .
I wonder how long it would take me to get in the same room as her if I exhausted all my available resources .
Thank you mike.

Also, there are not many 4 protect 1 drafts and defensive supports are popular too so it may just be an issue with the meta not being right for him.

Who in their right fucking mind would ever buy this.
So much brand loyalty with every person here. .
I'm in here because my cousin from NY is buying an apple watch and wants the tax free shopping. Also I'm blazed. .
Isn't the one in Christiana one of the largest in the country? It's the perfect confluence of circumstances: 2 seconds off 95 and no tax. They are printing money. .
Amazing thing to read and notice while in the store. .
There is a direct relation bishop between spacing between products in a retail store and profit on each item sold. Apple stores are so spacious, they only sell like 20 fucking things.

I dont know enough about the Philippines to refute you.
also "Yes" means "Yes".
"No" there actually means "Yes".
All you need to know about the Philippines is there is one big cultural difference.

Hey Andy I have a law business start up idea hit me up 515.808.2362.
Also, if a lawyer audited our legal stuff I'm pretty sure we would be out of business in a heartbeat.
Do you even know apps?.
How about the statute of frauds, aka, when contracts have to be written down?.
>the implication.
Woody, do you understand the contours of offer and acceptance? Consideration? Implied terms (be they implied in fact or implied by law)?.
ok i'll be your sock-em bopper clause expert. tag me in..
Em*.
You don't need a fancy degree to write contacts. Just write me up!.
Law school blows.
Dont do it.
i now want to be a contract attorney.
so combat by sock-em boppers.
So as long as the combat was legal it would be fine.
To answer the illegality of trial by combat in an agreement: you can't put terms in a contract that would violate the law/courts won't enforce them.

you decide.
whoever loses the underwear first what? wins or loses?.
mud wrestling; whoever loses the underwear first .
technically I don't think it's illegal?.
how illegal would it be to include a combat clause in a contract?.
Woody needs to learn to back up his words and contractual terms .
Trial by combat seems more appropriate here.
ez loophole.
he should've requested parley.
I mean, duh. .
Then Jon must being a fucking stud.
Reading is for nerds though.
Im not a lawyer yet, but I bet reading contracts is important.
If you're going to tell someone to follow the exact letter of a contract to bolster your argument, maybe read it first?.
Clearly.
Something went wrong.
#gif contractual obligation.
idiots. Everywhere.
Me - "It is literally why we have contracts, we're sticking to it".
Them - "We shouldn't stick to closely to the contract".
Me - "Our agreement says we will re-estimate and you will pay more. It says exactly that".
Them - "How dare you. We need to stick to the exact letter of our agreement. We won't pay more".
Me - "We estimated the project, it is $20k more".
I'll replay the conversation briefly.

The animal jokes also have varying levels of subtlety. It took me rewatching some episode to realize how many times bojacks owl gf says "who".
it's almost hard to stay on top of the show because the characters are well-written, but then they'll just toss in animal jokes to trivialize it all.
i did really enjoy where mr. penutbutter went bankrupt because he listned to vincent's advice.
"i'm not a cowboy, I'm a cowman!".
i just love his "i went to the stock market. i did a business." sort of attitude. and the fact that he seems to be the most well-adjusted, human person on the show... while being three kids in a trenchcoat.
honestly i thought he was funniest in the beginning when bojack just constantly told princess caroline that he was obviously multiple kids and she just ignored him.
my impression is that he'll stick around, but they'll never "uncoat" him.
but no major plotlines probably.
so he may see minor parts.
I'm sure he'll make a return. Too funny. .
she broke up with him.
I'm super curious where they're going to go with Vincent. Such a hilarious and new sort of character.

im honestly struggling to think of notable canadian /bands/.
Best Canadian band ever pls nerf.

On the plus side, I just put on some rush. .
This is crazy.
Aui seriously won them TI5 by forcing bans that no one would have made.
more like nah doto.
3) na doto best doto.
1) Jon is also a punk, 2) I am sad to aui go.
i mean fear is a flexible player. towards the end of when rtz was with eg he switched to mid, but i truly think aui is one of the strongest 4s in the game.
i guess i just dont like rtz; i think hes a punk.
Dunno. Fear didnt feel like a pos 1 in ti finals at leaat.
having both sumail and rtz hyper aggressive might not be so great .
meh fear is a lot more stable carry than rtz.
Fear to pos 4, rtz in fears slot.
Check the link, roster is already a thing.
maybe they get big daddy?.
I dunno man it's a different game up there.
aui's is more sad.
clockwerk bros unite.
aui was given no choice.
zai made a choice.
but it is.
I think it's good that he's young and aware enough to see that doto isn't everything.
i think zai leaving dota is more sad.
It's going to be a powerhouse team but sadface dot png.

#gif big butt.
but it seemed like they worked that out by TI.
the only negative thing i ever heard about aui was that ppd didn't like how vocal he was in the beginning because that was mostly ppds role.
maybe it was auis fault; who knows.
he has to realize how valuable aui was.
and PPD isn't an idiot.
but EG isn't just a group of 5 members, its an organization with a manager who should be a cool head here.
in the end they are pretty young and immature ;  weird decisions are not that surprising .
but i really am.
its weird that i'm this upset by this.
i just don't understand.
but it sounds like zai is taking a break from dota.
zai was a package when rtz went to secret.
and who would be joint at the hip with rtz.
rtz replacing fear?.
i just dont understand.
but that is so fucking stupid.
and for some reason it had to be a package deal.
ppd/charlie wanted arteezy back.
here is my guess.
they were actually one of the more consistent teams out there with that roster ; shame.
i want him on EG.
but still, fuck that.
obviously any team would jump to have him.
i mean yeah, he'll be fine.
well at least hes got some monies from the win.
i truly hope this is some kind of misunderstanding.
and as a fucking 4 position.
his naga and techies were so game changing that it forced teams to ban them.
the reason PPD was able to outdraft teams at TI was because AUI had 2 heroes that other teams just couldn't let him have.
i will actually be so upset at EG if this is true.
can they just kick some one off without reason? dont they sign contracts when they join a team?.
he was pretty instrumental for their wins.

The pokemon may have been fake but my pain was all too real.
ez 99 rare candies.
best cheat was the Missingno cheat on the coast of Cinnabar island.

12v12 is a completely different game than 10v10.
but this one goes up to 12.
need a totally new strategy.
Matt doesn't understand the impact or implication of amassing armies apparently.
ypu.
it's 12v12 now though.
Guys we already made a 10v10 plan. The build an army plan.

How would you actually nerf cooperation? Give gold for every time you "?" your own teammate?.
cooperation OP volvo pls.
Friendship and an actual gameplan op pls nerf.
snowball techies.
Snowballing sf op.
except that one time we got rekt.
Glowballs literally never fails.
and glow ballz to mop.
Glowballs always works.
good point moke.
durable team to soak up.
Naga is a fish and has scales.
I think still dunks & glow ballz works well.
So being able to scale is important I think.
spectre would be good.
And if you survive you get a ton of gold.
You level up super quick because of the kills.
Matt is always right.
Matt is right.
It's not like regular XP being split 10 ways.
Bristle seems good.
I don't think you need late game.
I'm pretty sure in this game mode they highly accelerate the gold and XP you accumulate.
But you would still need some late game. What are some durable carries early that scale.
I'm guessing lvl 1 rosh is standard in this mode.
Yeah heroes that come online early would be key.
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcyzepMG0l1rnvwt1.gif.
I think the game is so fighty that waiting for items is a fools errand.

Huskar with oracle wraith king and dazzle.
what about lich with aghs.
Ok neat.
And I'm pretty sure you can mike.
I wonder how huskars passive works with that.
Pa sounds like a great candidate. Low CD spells, high output. Idk if you can right click while wraithed.
any big right clicker.
yeah ro Husk, Troll, Sniper.
Like a PA or something, so she could yolo for longer?.
5 seconds is all it takes baby.
Who could benefit the most from that?.
You have to remember that you have 5 extra seconds.
How do you kill that which has no life?.
Not only for the other team but for yourself.
You ever play against that? It's 10/10 confusing.
No one ever dies.
Wraith king aghs.
Centaur aghs OP. Just run the other team over.
Good point.
no u dont.
Dont go all range. You need some initiators like sk or brewmaster.
just get a drow and go all auras range team.
Ok so you draft half the team to give damage buffs (lycan, troll, luna, venge beastmaster) and the other half AOE magic damage (lina, ww, ds etc...).
12 man vacuum.
dark seer wall.
throw in Elder Titan because he needs some attention.
Winter wyvern's nuke would be nasty.

Right, didn't think about soul rip.

^also potentially hidden treasure.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Island.
Like the g spot amirite.
The only evidence would be the treasure.. how could you claim to find it without showing the treasure?.
"many people have claimed to have found the treasure, but no one has provided any evidence".
I've.... Not heard of it. .
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenn_treasure.
has anyone ever heard of this?.
the mathematics behind finding a set of 10 heroes with a certain item set to maximize the amount of units you could have under a team's control under any given time are far beyond any of us.
UNLESS you aghs morph on an enigma, and then got an extra 6 eidolons.
I was thinking morph Aghs could replicate a good clone hero and start making new clones.
Better than a morph.
that's an extra 6 units.
also, what about getting an enigma in there with eidolons?.
In fact it would be way funnier if you just went up mid dominating ever enemy creeps.
man, with the new golems that split.
Plus you can dominate lane creeps for extra lolz.
There's enough Jungle, just everyone wouldn't get good creeps.
http://www.myinstants.com/instant/its-a-disaster-6mil-echoslam/.
buttz.
Also, what if there was an aghs on ES, so that there's two echos instead of one.
There isn't enough jungle to fuel this idea.
+50.
oh okay.
Lets be reasonable here Stu, Helms are expensive. Everyone already has to buy Manta.
why not +60 through helms?.
so 52 Units through levels and skills +30 through Manta + another 20 through Helms.
Infinity is only limited by your imagination.
You can buy as many helm of dominators as you want on any hero already.
done.
just don't clump up.
even more if there is a creep wave.
6010 magic damage.
*20.
thats another 30.
If everyone bought Manta....
Imagine what the blackhole would look like.
It'd be hilarious.
I'd love to die in that echo slam.
52!.
that would be a max of 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + ~10 + ~5 + 2 + 10! + 4 = 52 controllable units.

Wait who.
i assume that JOHN CENA could probably break a guys jaw.
i just dont think i could.
Excuse me while I ignore the advice and reasons that don't back up my preconceived world views.
to clarify, i'm not saying *someone* couldnt break a persons jaw with a single punch.
I did a really stupid thing to cause myself to fall off my bike.
I'm not convinced you're not just a klutz.
I broke my jaw when I was 10 because I faceplanted on to concrete from falling off my bike.
You'd have to be strong as fuck to break someones jaw with your fist in one punch.
I mean, I don't agree, but your research is appreciated.
<3.
Andy thank you for the most well reasoned response I could have asked for.
I do not believe I could. i once wound up and hit scott blaha in the face as hard as i could. he was walking into it and did not expect it. I will never get a better punch than that, and all i did was make his eye swell shut. pretty sure unless there is some special angle I may have hit him at, I do not think it would have broken his jaw.
heres a question woody and i were somewhat debating the other night: do you think, if you got a good wind up, and the other guy wasn't expecting it, and you didn't glance it, you could punch someone and break their jaw?.
i ended up going 6-2. i'll take it.

Get his address and stuff some Mayo and bread and chicken in an envelope so that by the time it gets there it had spoiled.
Then mail a bag of bones.

also, i didn't know that cdec and EG scrimmed a bunch together before the tournament, and even between the groupstage and the main event.
but yeah, being forced to first-ban techies and naga HAD to hamstring cdec.
turns out when you have a team of 5 strong players bans get hard.
also, all of cdecs first 2 bans targetted aui heroes and then the rest of their bans usually targetted sumail which is pretty funny.

No argument that it was good, and that a lot of that faded over time. But even when the simpsons was at its best it doesnt measure up. The important point though is that it isnt their fault. Every show that came after had the chance to look at what the simpsons had done first and improve. The model-t sucks compared to modern cars, but those cars had the chance to benefit from years of innovation.
Simpsons is probably the funniest show in the planet when they were in their prime. Seasons 1-10 are gold.
Also you suck.
If you think its really better than those other shows we're discussing nostalgia is clouding your judgment.
But so many shows that came after did so many things so much better.
Simpsons was important like citizen Kane but has aged just as well.
It broke ground.
Simpsons was historically important.
^wrong matt.
Especially because so many are so different .
1) Simpsons
Nothing else matters.
I know, its so hard to decide.
Oof ordering them is a risky game.
Although honorable mention to sealab 2021. Such a uniquely hilarious show.
I think my favorite animated shows in order are:
1. Rick and Morty
2. Futurama
3. Archer
4. Bojack
5. Bob's Burgers.
I think it rides the line of funny and deep really well.
But it is definitely close.
Wow, bold. Thats a hard call for me. .
Willing to say better than Archer.
Ok finally finished second season. This might be the best animated show since futurama.
Both times when he is getting kicked out of someones life who is close to him.
Because it was fucking real.
It turns out the less you curse the more impact it has.
And that (bokack) episode is only the 2nd time in the series they used fuck.
The last episode of rick and morty reminded me of bojack on the dark level.

Gyro lesh cough cough also glimmer cape.
A few heroes need nerfs but overall amazing games.
Yeah the games I've watched have been so exciting.
Ok say what you will but this ti meta is pretty ok.
Although eg still have 2 tier 2s up so they wouldnt lose their whole base if they lost a fight.
Its still so close. One teamfight could decide this I think.
Nvm looks like he just died.
Fear has still yet to die this game.
excellent fight by eg.
Storm gyro and double silencer ulty is terrifying.
Still really worried about lgd's lategame.
Eg basically setting the pace with aggression.
Eg doing well but game is close.
Giff updates.

Really wish I could watch this on twitch.
Also means that storm can go bloodstone and still get pickoffs as if he had an orchid.
Yup. I'm worried for eg, the silencer pick is gonna make getting off a good black hole tough.

Its like a dumb downed version of dota.
That game blows. Not even kidding. .
He was describing the game they play and it sounded like dota so I had him ask.

Also he has friends that play heros of the storm.
Opposed.
Id be tempted to add him to this groupchat temporarily because it would be funny.
@BigBillz why you gotta be so salty bruh .

this upper bracket lower bracket thing seems to be throwing you for a loop mike.
winner of that plays CDEC in finals.
winner of VG LGD plays EG.
I don't know enough about brackets to refute you.
PPD is gonna look at what happened, learn from his mistakes, and come back even stronger. plus he has so many VG games to study so they;re gonna be really prepared if they play them tomorrow.
i am still confident that EG have a good shot.
eg did get rekt, but they lost the ub at DAC too, and then came back to win the tournament by crushing their opponents.
2nd eg game was a moke rage quit.
Jon, whatever happened with that tinder girl you were messaging who was moving to hawaii?.
EG got rekt.
couldnt keep his balls pumped.
Why is Brady suspended for 4 games.

I don't know enough about predator prey eye shaping to dispute it.
I would assume the preditors need to spot specific details whereas prey would just try and spot movement in general. .
Vagina shaped pupils = savages .

this doesn't look good for the side i assume we are all rooting for.

is there an enigma-guy in the audience.
black HOLLLLLLLLLL.
Man that guy rocks.
Can we talk about how cool enigma is?.

what the fuck sense does it make that he does infinity damage early.
also gyro's fucking rocket barrage.
Planet erf since berf.
Erf.
and even if, urf.
unless you have a silence _early_ he's god.
its just ball, that's the everything.
That shit is way too spammavle, which would in turn nerf overload.
Or they could increase the cool down on static remnant.
Yeah. Overload is crazy.
go fucking cry with tinker in the trashcan.
its the stupid fucking damage on overload.
Him and terrorblade on the sidelines.
Gg never picked again.
-1 base armor.
i would not cry if storm got nerfed.
Unbalanced thunder goat.
balanced lightening horse.
Lesh 100% ban rate in the main event.
Hes super hard to use, but in the right hands hes unstoppable.
i haven't even _seen_ lesh get played.
It's just how he can split a team or isolate a player.
lesh will defo get nerfed so he's not 1p/1b.
i guess, but he's not 1p/1b but his impact is crazy.
They could reduce the range on ES stun, or at least the duration of the fissure block.
 Lesh is getting nerfed. I say they increase the cool down or mana cost on his lightning to reduce its spammability.
prolly not.
i wonder if they'll nerf ES after ti? i think wyvern will get one 4 sho but ES's range is bonkers for stunz.
Yeah ez money.
wow gifted that rosh.
this game is a bloodbath.
Still tho.

Define "old".
No, I was like 'aha...alright, I'm gonna go over here now'.
"I bet your granddaughter is hot".
Did you compliment her back, Jon.
Maternity leave I understand,  PTO no way.
An old woman called me sexy at the gym today. It was a very uncomfortable experience. .
Thank you. WillowTree is thinking about putting in unlimited PTO and I went on a huge rant against it.
It feels like you have to ask permission for PTO... Which ruins it.
^^this is my life right now. It sucks. .
so you wouldn't feel guilty or potentially shamed for taking PTO?.
wouldn't you rather have a high but fixed amount?.
You obviously can't take PTO everyday forever, so you don't actually have unlimited. Which means you have some vague amount of PTO which means your employer could always be second guessing the amount of time you take off.
Unlimited PTO or Maternity leave is horseshit.

like whether its a phone number, a gps location etc....
is there any service that takes strings of numbers like that and then tries to make a best guess as to what they are?.
Or some kind of secret code?.
who the fuck knows, at least put some ( or . or - in it.

it looks like they just jammed numbers at me.

>[Piercings] are like any body art, they're great when done tastefully. I think that [some piercings are] too much, but the[y can be] excellent.
Thoughts on piercings?.
I think that tattoo you posted is too much ink for anyone to have on their body but tons of people would disagree with me.
That's fair. But everyone's going to have different opinions when it comes to this kind of stuff. It's all subjective..
I don't know if I like any tattoos on a girl. That is unless, of course, she's really hot. .
*out of .
A southern belle type girl would be put of place with a tattoo .
Tattoo has to fit the girl .
I dated a girl with a sweet fish tattoo on her arm. She was already super cool and the tattoo just added to it.
^agree 100%.
Tattoos are like any body art, they're great when done tastefully. I think that tattoo is too much, but the quality is excellent.

*drinking solutions.
Or drinking problems?.
Did you talk about the drugs?.
Was it because we're all in the same groupme?.

Andy you feeling a little.
That's actually confusing. What is there to miss?.
That joke went full steam ahead, no reservations.
Too ez.
harsh.
thank.
I've seen Andy and Liz together. Does that count?.
you can think annie.
Man the bear joke might be the one we've gotten the most mileage out of, ever.
Have you guys seen train wreck?.
this phoenix = lrn2ult scrub.
yeah, the humor was lost on her bear brain.
Andy and I were watching a bunch of those videos with Liz. She was 10/10 confused.
DEET DOH DOH DAAAAH.
DOO DAAH DOOT DAAAAAH.
Are you ready?.

That Asian?.
Ever.
I also did once. Then I never stopped.

i hooked up with an asian once.
surprisingly not me .
cant help it when jons around.
there's a decent amount of yellow fever in this groupme.
Everyone likes Asians. What's not to like?.
my wood likes asians too.
Lol woody likes Asians.

Even Comcast isn't bringing me down.
I'm riding so high right now.
Spicy azn.
That was in fact a hot Asian girl.

I also just gave someone going to TI tomorrow $100 and told him to bring me swag.
Woody knows how to celebrate.
Gonna make a sandwich to celebrate.
High fives all around.
Boom just closed an app deal.
Secret ehome.
Yeah, draft is almost done.
Just one game jon.
Is secret playing?.
I wish I wasn't in the god damn gym right now. .
So sick.
Sick.
Secret come out wearing sungalsses.
lol that secret entrance.
Fear is so stoic.
He is actually a really great guy. Good job fear. .
Fear is a nice dude. Interviews really well. .
true. even if there is some small chance.
I get it I guess. Its the international. .
Universe is awesome.
so i guess col are just gonna refuse to ever gg before a team takes their ancient.
What a stomp.
Did you guys see the sumail remnant into blink double dodge. .
Nvm.
Nvm.
Dieback!!.
universe went lotus orbe instead, lol.
Wait a second..
8-33, just throw in the towel boys.
And a better friend .
Dragos, you're a better dazzle than this guy.
i wanna see him kick someone.
i hope universe gets aghs.
This game is pretty embarrassing .
they should probably call gg.
But thank god I have no reception. The message didn't go through. .
Holy shit. I'm texting that girl and I accidentally wrote "this timber blows ass".
good item.
Like, always.
Someone always has a medallion .
they still managed to win because ee, who was standing in, carried on luna.
he once fell so far behind on ember that he had to go ghost scepter.
*rtz's.
rts's ember is infamous.
lol, not at ember.
still though, RTZ > Sumail .
He's good at the slight searing chain combo. .
Sumail*.
Symbol is ridiculous.
bye bye Complexity.
My gawd.
like stopping to have a smoke while you're slowly stabbing someone. .
Like, what the hell dudes.
the fucking pause to buy shit at the secret shop.
Complexities positioning is crap.
omg..
lol ez .
making Crystal Maiden look like a boss ass bitch .
PPD. .
Sumail is just running around at this point .
euls is all you need .
shes good i like playing her as support.
lina just isnt that good of a support i think.
col 2 greedy.
Welp. Looks like EG wants my fatass to go to the gym .
just paste a picture of sven there.
#kited.
he must be buying everything.
its absurd that ppd is still lowest on net worth even though he's farming the jungle on CM.
Brian >.
i think storm is still his best, but he definitely plays a good ember.
I've never seem him play ember before.
yeah he's in his comfort zone.
Sumail is playing very well.
My thought process would've been, "fuck runnnnn!".
^.
you were pretty good at knowing when to go in on pa.
its just understanding the limits of the hero you're playing.
The coherence to know that he wasn't in any trouble with flame guard on and to turn back toward two heroes during a gank is the higher skill level stuff I don't have. .
The LSAs are on point.
I hope complexity evens the series so I don't have to go to the gym yet .
Big stuns.
Dank memes.
LOL at the signs.
The dude with the 'pick riki, no balls' sign lol.
TIMBERRRRRR.
i like dk offlane .
Teams like Dragon Knight .
Oooh razor.
Incoming TA pick?.
Team buff armor.
techies + tusk too stronk.
its always the team without the tusk that bans techies.
Techiez ban again.
They weren't .
Those must have been some tiny turds.
They took a shit down their tear ducts .
Those tactical pauses worked.
yes.
Who won, EG?.
the disrespectful epicenter .
gg half a second before throne dies.
Universe is so clutch.
S-stop is the most disrespectful shit we do.
It'd be fun to be a dick now. Deny aegis. S-stop on Effigies .
GG.
Their inexperience is shining through.
they could probably have even done an aggressive lane.
PPD is insane .
they deefinitely needed to put more pressure on fear.
Octarine is such a bad pick.
Or an orchid.
If complexity got a sheepstick this game would be so different.
ez game.
they hit the time and boom.
eg had a timing where they were really strong and they didnt fall too far behind.
can't believe how much this game shifted .
G fuckin G.
THAT EPI.
UNIVERSE.
he has a pics with seals and nephews.
show us jon.
Game on!.
which was ironic after judging literally hundreds of women.
Because he's a bitch.
jon wouldnt show us his tinder profile.
Because you should change it to that.
Jon, what's your tinder tagline?.
maybe hes mom is on smth ... like hallucinogens .
Hilarious ^.
http://www.clickhole.com/article/we-challenged-man-survive-minimum-wage-and-he-imme-2028.
this would be a great online dating profile.
"Hey this guys mom is onto something".
> Hey, this guys mom may be on to something.
that is something i would think of .
Clickhole is so good.
^ I thought that was hilarious .
jon i love this.
http://www.clickhole.com/article/6-pictures-me-i-really-hope-make-you-say-what-hand-2814.
the director had them shoot the explicit sex scene for hours.
That's probably why you don't direct films jon.
"no no no, kiss her like this...".
thats what happened in blue is the warmest color.
If I were the director, I'd make them retake that scene like 10 times.
They're coming back to their booths.
oh fuck yeah.

Yeah, its been like an hour.
are they still pause?.
I usually love watching cringe stuff, that was tough for me. .
what is gojng on with the game.
I want that 10 minutes of my life back.
The whole thinf.
Jesus Christ that was brutal .
matt. did you watch all of that..
do we know wtf happened to the game.
Its a trainwreck.
Still watching.
I dunno if I can take this .
i dont want to know.
dont even describe it to me.
jesus.
but obviously freeze mage just sucks against warrior, its the single worst matchup in hearthstone.
Andy. some guy just started singing into the mic .
omg..
dragos, you are describing fatigue/control/giants echo mage.
i know.
Andy you would hate this.
i turned it off.
so much cringe. is everyone watching this shit. .
i thin a molten freeze would be a lot better.
the prob with freeze mage is you have no minions to chip away at his armor.
but occasionally when you do it feels so good.
These nerds are so fucking cringe worthy.
as someone who plays freeze mage, those games are so hard to win as the mage.
True.
i dont think the card would be included in many decks though jon because it would only be good against warriar and maybe freeze mage.
some games the armor gets out of control becomes impossible to win.
it would give them a chance.
Warrior would be very difficult if that's the case..
as a mage spell?.
do 5 damage to the opposing hero, ignore armor.
one that does damage through armor would be strong.
wtf is an alexstraza?.
i wonder if theyll put in a card that strips all armor away.
i think i ended the game with over 30 armor.
he used all his burn on my shit, and then conceded when i gorehowled his antonidas.
sad mage.
haha armor ftw.
eziest game of my lyfe.
I need to put in some owls to get past belchers and stuff but otherwise, it just murders so fast. .
although earlier i cued as a control warriar against a freeze mage.
hilarious rhymes cancerous .
yeah, all my games are against face/midrange hunter or aggro pally.
That's what I've been playing lately. Its hilarious. .
Wait I also didn't realize we were taking about aggro pally. .
radiance op.
just the tiniest bit of magic damage would finish off everyone.
yeah what i said would actually be a trash ult.
Blocks all physical .
wait i dont remember does ga block physical or just prevents you from being killed by physical.
Its a strength hero .
The hero is pretty tanky, you can walk up pretty far. .
i keep my supports pretty far back.
i think for me omnis hardest thing is the short range .
But dazzul.
With anger and a short fuse. .
Okay, we try tonight. I will teach. .
i can practice my omni more just so we both can do either .
jon we should perfect an omni venge support duo.
Totally.
Maybe an offensive swap with the omni venge mix would instead add the wave of terror minus armor to the swapped enemy .
unlike face hunter for example.
the only redeeming factor is that if you manage to get board control, then its super hard for them to deal killing damage.
yeah its so fucking annoying.
also unrelated i fucking hate the aggro pally.
i would prob not be worth her spit .
Maybe you just need a girl to spit on you and call you names. .
im doing it again.
thats prob why i cant talk to girls and also lose at life.
i enjoy self deprecation maybe too much.
dragos with the self burn.
keeps your core from having to farm one.
redundant with my butt.
you just get blink on venge and then swap in an ally to the enemy team.
your face is redundant.
usually if you swap them theyre safe.
and its redundant.
but then you cant use it offensively.
 wait.
The venge omni mix ult would be once you swap, it also GA's just that hero .
matt tell em : respectful canadian RAGEEEE.
Yeah this is ridiculous. They have a whole year to prepare.
is that too much to ask?.
i just want to procrastinate and watch dota 2.
jesus this is obnoxious.
Aaaaaaand twitch is down for me.
Sweet hair tho.
This dude with the man bun thinks he lifts a lot .
How would the ult work?.
A combination of Venge and Omniknight though sounds awesome. .
Sounds horrible .
so you won't play him?.
Zet, arc warden. Hes like meepo and techies combined .
and big clothed barely breasted women.
Zet you say.
Still need Pitlord and Zet.
and big breasted barely clothed women .
Nah.
Guys it was earth spirit in captains.
More fireworks.
big tittied women .
plus if they did it perfectly, what would they improve on next year?.
they were so close!.
We let them down.
Needed 61 million.
was 60 million not enough to get decent computers?.
why is this still paused?.
+1 Jon point for sincerity from the butt chin man for talking about his lack of knowledge and still love watching dota .
I don't know enough about salmonella to refute him.
you dont know enough about medicine to refute me.
andy that isn't how it works.
which have salmon.
because jewish people eat lox.
he might suffer from salmonella.
I think you'd be OK, Israelis are a natural clean and STD free people.
Get your junk checked out after that Stu. .
Wow.

#what would sty do?.
I would do several htings to have one of those.
Omg this faceless rec.
Great use of scuttle.
you can blame it all on me!.
baby come back@!.
woody noooo.
I'm scuttling back out of the convo.
yea.
Ah.
Read mikes question woody!.
and delay the dagon.
Rubick with a stolen blink, refresher, blink dagger, and force.
itms are just fluff.
puck only needs his skills and blink.
euls too maybe if we count elusive as mobile.
i was thinking puck with force blink octarine.
woah Andy this boat info is good stuff.
^lol.
Other than storm maybe Anti-mage with blink, refresher, force staff.
storm with mana regen items and bots.
q: what is the most mobile hero and itemset you can make up.
hex woulda been good though, i agree with matt.
honestly though its the ult.
moar blinks, mobility op.
30 sec ults.
So stupid..
Why the fuck did qop go for octarine?.
first game still going, eg just pulled ahead a bit.
oh ok.
cant watch.
First game still happening.
i have lots of mice to disect .
eg won first?.
http://i.imgur.com/zCBQP8s.gif.
#neat.
its like forced rental in emergencies.
but if they damage something they have to pay for it.
in an emergency you have to let people come onto your land.
they won.
they sued.
they crashed.
he said "fuck you guys".
these people were on a boat in a storm and tried to dock on some guys dock.
go on.
did you know "any port in a storm" actually has legal precedence.
Just crank one out and then you won't for an hour. Rinse and repeat. Ez. .
my sister in law was saying today that it would be nice to watch the upcoming rainstorm from inside our house's porch. i said, "it doesn't really matter if it's this one, could be the neighbors, could be across the street." "why," she asked. "well, any porch in a storm".
I miss it =\.
<---- this butt Jon.
sUN is following the game because she's *in the computer*.
sUN knows.
damn right.
Andy Esposito.
#who isn't?.
^ yo, that butt is still fuckin awesome .
Caught me.
Matthew.
#who is worried?.
Tactical pauses.
#gif spooky.
FEAR OP!!!.
i turned the game on and suddenly eg is just WAHABAM.
EG EG EG.
i was never even worried.
Wtf coL.
Holy shit.
OMFG.
OMG let's go fear!!!.
and its really nice to know that people aren't wasting that.
i read somewhere that he's bisexual and has orgies.
and all the rest of this is just compensation.
what if he had like a comically tiny dong.

what does that say guys.
also woody. he will know when kight rider is playing.

#what can I do learn how to read .
Finally Jon can understand what is going on.
it even shows the heros moves.
also, how cool is the twitch feature showing the players and heros?.
agreed.
Lame.
paused.
Why is the game not on twitch.
The clinkz needs to try and find Fear and kill.
fuck you QoP.
Holy balls man, pure damage from clinkz .
#Quien .
viva mexico.
i think eg is still in this though.
ban chen maybe.
Assuming EG loses this game, what do they change next game .
he isnt gonna solo take over the game, but if the rest of eg play well he'll pull through.
How much faith do you have in a fear carry?.
going vlads I'd say.
he needsa armor.
he'll melt to clinkz.
manta won't even save him.
Next item is manta on AM right.
and clinkz deso.
QoP aghs.
they have great highground d.
and naga.
they have lina spam, sandking and winter wyvern.
unless universe pulls off a 3 man stun epicentre.
If EG comes back and wins this, I'll be very surprised .
they can't d highground.
they'll end up winning.
but i think if am can pressure other lanes, and eg can d highground ok.
SHADOW STRIKE.
they could, especially given the push complexity has.
Definitely.
EG could easily lose this.
clinkz going deso.
yup.
What is this, best of 3?.
early deso on clinkz I'd imagine.
they'll be at T3s at 25 mins I'd say.
coL are moving so fast.
sneaky roshan. Complexity is rolling. .
Gotta get that manta on the AM.
that hook.
idk who has better late game, but i think complexity need to get enough of a lead so that EG cant win the game when AM peaks.
K, those rocket flares are fuckin sick.
Complexity has a time limit to their window right.
because he can just sit behind heroes waiting for a gank and counterinitiate.
if universe gets a quick blink i think its gg.
No universe nooo.
EAT A DICK PUSS.
LOL.
THE BLOCKS NIGGA.
I feel like Universe should be in medical school or working for NASA by now .
I wonder what these guys studied in college .
because naga's box size is smaller than most heroes, she can walk through tusk ice shards.
BigNasty > Sumail.
^ .
Brian > Sumail.
also, fun fact that might come up this game.
RTZ > Sumail .
ez lyfe.
ez gaem.
freefarming am.
he's making space.
Never been a fan honestly. .
GG. Sumail blows.
G FUCKIN G'.
no sight on invis rune?.
g fuckin g.
I want EG to embarrass them .
priming the comeback gold.
Ez double rune GG.
double rune, gg.
i love pirate tusk.
AM must be so warm with all those blankets on his head.
The items everyone has on their heroes are so dope .
he's a pretty solid player.
I think to be a great mid, you must be an aggressive player .
i wonder how good moon's click is.
and cast the game.
to dress up as axe.
to get the voice of axe.
Sorry.
you know what would be awesome?.
You're ridiculous.
he's ridiculous.
no, Xyclopz.
they should get him for the allstar match.
and chuck norris.
I wish Jason Bateman was casting this from Dodgeball.
It's impossible not to like him.
so the game is, can clinkz successfully gank AM during the period after he gets orchid but before AM gets manta.
I've tried it and it is 100% fun though.
Universe is the man .
Clock farms too slowly for orchid to be a thing.
orchid clinkz.
how about early game when there's only one point in it? maybe orchid clock?.
Complexity's draft confuses me.
MAH NIGGA.
CLONKZ.
And I do think he can blink out.
Spell shield makes battery assault tickle.
can you get blink off during battery assault?.
that rock looks like a penis.
??? 100% am is fine against clock.
can't blink during battery assault.
ppd is gonna go tree or something.
AM in to clock is tough.
Complexity looks like ultra nerds .
i bet its aui naga.
at least i think he did in the group stage.
maybe, but universe has been running it a lot recently.
I tihnk that's an aui SK.
too greedy for ppd.
offlane universe sand king.
I'd be super surprised to see a SS picked.
ooo.
for no raisen.
I'd like to see a venge.
i'm gonna say shadow shaman.
eg pugna pick incoming.
^truth but tinker is fortunately not really played right now unlike the other two.
tinker is in the same realm IMO.
yeah, brood and techies are such niche picks that almost play their own separate games.
make the game normal and then just try and outplay them.
brood and techies.
they just banned heros that suck to play against.
what a time to be alive.
lol.
EG banned techies.
i hope they do well in the loser's bracket.
i do like complexity though, even though i'm rooting for eg.
"life coach and condoms".
ppd went to it when they went against cdec and needed 2 wins to get 1st in the group.
50 cent expenses.

ppd is salt.
 aww fly is so nice.
mm good point moke.
Also she is pretty.
yea.
Despite all the cringe, she does a lot of good stuff.
i feel like she struck gold by getting in on the ground floor of this a few years ago.
i like her ; it takes a lot of guts to be in her position as a complete outsider.
If we're going to stereotype the fanbase, a lot of them aren't the most charismatic and outgoing people, and she really makes an effort to bring these people out of their shells.
People give Kaci a lot of shit, but I think she does a great job of interviewing these players and fans.
fly is a handsome fella .
definitely respect that. the dude is a true position 5.
one more thing in favor of ppd: you've got to respect his selfless playstyle.
I want that as a gif.

still rooting for coL though.

Jon don't rule out the bathroom selfie for dudes. You want dudes in good shape.
"hold my beer".
bro tinder sounds hilarious.
then its all good.
only if you say "no homo" after.
bros can be bicurious no?.
They're on the wrong social network. This is for bros, not dudes tryna bang other dudes. Common misconception. .
un ironic poses of courses .
what abou shirtless bathroom mirror selfies.
Pictures with bongs and mad weed would be my version of the 45 degree rule. .
ppd ez right swipe.
broinder.
Let's do a bro version of tinder. Swipe right if you would like to play doto, order pizza and drink beers together .
if this were tinder you'd swipe no.
but also he's 19.
jon i can legit seeing you being friends with him.
We'd pick on kids together and listen to Rich Homie Quan .
I'd be friends with RTZ. .
nah, i have to fold laundry.
im itching for doto now; anyone in?.
indeed.
when it counts they deliver.
either way it will be fun to watch.
they still manage to do well in the end though.
look at any of their past tournaments.
they always look shaky in the groups.
they looked a lil shaky in the group.
im not sure how strong eg are right now.
#?.
not eg.
and guess what team he's on?.
aui is one of the only other pros that seems genuine.
sad but true.
and zai is like 12.
ppd is honest about his personality unlike some pros (aka sing sing).
haha.
those other guys seem nice, but i've heard them talk on stream and i don't totally get their humor, and being a nice person doesn't make you fun to hang out with.
I think I'd like to hang out with zai. He probably likes to smash windows in abandoned buildings. I can get behind that.
i would go on long dates with kuro and puppey so youre wrong.
he is basically the only pro i think i would actually enjoy hanging out with for extended periods.
ppd is the only pro player i would want in this group.
People really dislike ppd.
not sure about most likable.
Counterpoint: ppd.
matt you are cray cray.
eg is the best and most likable team.
yeah secret boyzz.
Eg can blow it out their asses.
Welp. Guess I'm cheering for secret.
what a vocab choice.
dendi was chief dendrophile for the last half .
if they tried a serious push they would have just lost the teamfight.
They needed pickoffs before pushing.
Feelsbadman .
they had an es.
i disagree. navi couldnt push uphill.
i dunno man im disappointed in navi.
VG played it so smart.
The end was awesome.
That game was sweet.
just the end and only cause they were throwing mid game.
Is that the last game of the night?.
that game was so exciting!.
subpar?.
the game was subpar.
what is this guy smoking.
damn that was exciting.
soneiko fucked up a few relocates too.
Artstyle why.
aw Andy .
haha.
they didnt play well.
that was an andy shallow grave.
Artstyle.
NOOOOOO.
OMG.
They're fucking defending their ancient .
WHAT THE FUCK.
HOLY YFKFJDHDBAJS.
jesus fuck.
Wtf are they doing.
snoozefest .
Shame *bell ring*.
wtf.
dendi stopped doing shit.
Being very careless.
Yeah.
xboct has played a very mediocre game all things considered .
gg boyz.
its always women ... making men play worse dota.
lakshmi ono.
He's not very good..
They need racks from this aegis .
Get rekt.
if they dont have the late late game.
why isnt navi pushing as 5.
AM pushes so hard.
Same for VG tho.
If na'vi fucks up once, the Luna will break the base .
Dendis looking for a pickoff.
what is this game.
dazzzuuuul.
What is dendi doing..
what is dendi doing.
They're just throwing them kills.
such risky plays for marginally more farm .
i think they need to replace xboct .
thats meeee.
Dragos, the all time support .
dont lose hope jon im here for you.
Pretty bad fight. Could be the beginning of the end .
MY HEART.
this game is sick.
But same with the rubick plays.
These io plays are sick.
dendi mvp.
THE BOYS ARE DOING IT.
Let's do it!.
Pls na'vi .
HOKY FUCK.
YHE RELOCATE.
OMG.
Wow.

The hell was that?.
Not sure who that favors .
Pretty passive few minutes .
Hes getting Vlad's noe.
Let's go na'vi .
Is that an immortal animation on the rubic tele?.
deathball incoming.

wtf!.
LUNA.
anger joy?.
Sonneiko io.
They're mostly hilarious.
Sometimes.
does iceiceice have emotions?.
indeed.
Rubick is the most picked / banned hero of all time.
If there was an East and West Berlin team still, Earthshaker would be the first pick.
Rubik fenrir.
 i wonder how a mixed russian  ukrainian team works in terms of dynamics with the whole war / invasion thing going on.
AM is a good pickup.
ice es.
dendi is so cute.
>I did a business.
>Thanks!.
i dont mind redeye leading the general analysis, but when it comes to draft i wish he'd just shut the fuck up.
wow matt.
You're not though.
Super is so ugly. Jesus..

clockwerk is a lot of fun to play.
makes me want to scream with pleasure.
Makes me want to scream.
i love cockwerk.
Literally my least favourite sound in the game is getting hooked.
I hate clockwerk.
Each interaction and individual fight in the big fights is so calculated and well played.
I feel like they're playing at a pace that's significantly faster than normal.
Nope, probably won't be.
Has doom been picked yet.

Eat a salty dick.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_starvation.
>what hell.
>rabbit starve.
By woody's own words, he would eat a dick if it was dunked in butter.
Also, they used to feed it to slaves and they would rabbit starve and die.
You don't need butter for it.
The tears of the proletariat.
Disagree, lobster is very rich.
It's savory meat mixed with savory butter. Just an overload of one taste. Too much. .
Lobster has no contrasting flavor!.
Wait yea I'm actually getting all riled up.
Woofy pls.
Later maybe.
I'm too tired to rant but I've got one loaded for this .
Anything you dunk in butter is good.
Thanks woody. Now to Andy with the weather.
Woody, for a man who loves food, you don't seem to appreciate lobster.
Hustler is nice. Why is she so wet though? She wet in all the wrong place so.
Could.

how the fuck is vg in the lower bracket?.
i didnt even realize that match was happening.
thats so intense.
Be still my beating heart.
Best of one, elimination.
NaVi VG tonight.
Psychedelic rock. They're like early Cream.
I agree. Captured a sound that no one else has. .
IMO one of the best for rock bands on the planet right now.
Love them.
Matt. Are you a fan of tame impala .
best of 1s.
they played better.
and yeah, i think there are lower bracket games jon.
you gotta respect cdec.
gg.
some best of ones.
c9.
Are there still more games tonight?.
i go euls too; it gives so much ; speed regen survivability.
Had a shit ton of that last weekend and it was so god damn delicious .
I never build it on him. I always go euls first, then force if I really need it.
Woody, did you eat / save the crackling from your previous pig roast .
euls or force are so much better.
i also never liked blink on zeus.
gyro and legion should be enough with that.
Octarine is likely going to help them though cause they're going to need to turtle. It also helps with the spam to keep down the PL illusions.
Veil would be tight with skywrath and gyro.
Yeah exactly.
i dunno they need extra damage octarine doesnt help with that.
Interesting.
This Zeus went soul ring blink octarine.
its about misfits finding a place in the world and being happy.

Yea mike, watched the video, he showed up, good relating Dota to basketball (5v5, team cooperation, etc ).
That's where their heart is.
is that where their face is?.

doesnt it also give extra regen when you do that too?.
yeah it took me a second to understand how they killed it so fast.
I keep forgetting you can tango wards.

How much would you pay for the cufflinks jon.

wait, so this dude they're interviewing used to be on Newbee but then joined LGD?.
You easily could.
Made me wish I could get deal-with-it-dog cufflinks for woody's wedding.
I just realized the butt chin guy is wearing a sniper emoji pin.
I just want cringe interviews with fans.

Stu, you won't get "Hallmark Movies & Mysteries".
the amount of time I have to watch tv to make it worth it is low.
TBS, TNT, FX, I feel like you lose a lot of channels.
so maybe espn on that?.
thinking about slingbox, although new apple tv is coming out in sept., and disney & apple are pals.
but, sports bars.
no espn.
I have 100 channels & HBO.
sorry, no ESPN?.
but you also are missing out on a lot of channels? No HBO?.

What. That's messed up .
I just learned about the fact that they have data caps though, which is bullbutter.
so it's 75 Mbps I think?.
Ask her what her boogers taste like .
did the promotional thing $55/month for blast & hbo.
BLAST.
Stu, what level of Internet do you have.
ask her if she's going to fuck herself or if you need to run out for some condoms?.
I love this game.
^right here.

also ask her, 'how can she slap'.
also woody i have comcast if you're still on that grind.
how does bird law best get represented by genesis 21:69.
look up lots of bible passages, and throw them into your questions.
Ask how it was growing up in Greensboro, North Carolina. And if she enjoyed her mother's job as a Librarian or her farther's job as a Baptist minister..
Really go for the throat .
Her husband has 2 children from an earlier marriage, ask her if she loves those kids as much as her own.
If there was a mask of my face, would you wear it?.
Do you want to see some of my watercolors.
^ I get that reference.
Ask her if she's ever seen a grown man naked.

Ask her about her plan to reform Bird Law in this country.

http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/10/the-incredible-mystery-of-the-trials-evolution-riddle/.
Andy, the recent videogame Trial Evolution had a secret which won't get solved for 100 years.
Accidentally changed the group name to what I wanted my nickname to be. .
Jonny G changed name to Rich Homie Jon.
Jonny G changed the group's name to > What Hell.
Jonny G changed the group's name to Rich Homie Jon.
The world must know about CAN EAT MORE.
We must never let this groupchat die. Future generations will know of "8===D".
I will remind Desrosiers about  8====D. Beep boop..
#remindme "1000 years" 8====D.
Boom, first clue.
And then do one of those services that sends an email in the future.
And message 100 years from now telling someone to check an email account with the username and password for it.
If I was gonna do a treasure hunt for a future generation, this would be how I would have it begin.
Sweet.
I will remind english122 about  get a tetanus booster. Beep boop..

We actually have a bunch of blood and stool samples stored to do bird flu research on .
Matt's doomed us all.
Is this how bird flu starts?.
The lab smells a bit riper than normal today.
I'm lucky because I don't do any genetic or fatty acid work where stuff has to be stored at -80, all my stuff can sustain a bit of thawing.
Because someone seriously fucked up.
I'm no Hanukkah expert, but that isn't enough fuel  .
Why did the generators not have enough fuel to last through the night?.
moke what an amazing decision.
Moke did.
who put cascada on the playlist?.
sUN can shove it.
but technically, so far as sUN is concerned, that is a pretty "good" morning.
bummer.
Our freezers were down for 6 hours and its hot as shit here now so I'm going through all our freezers seeing what samples have spoiled.
Here how my mornings going: Today is a statutory holiday, so I wasn't planning on going in to work. But, I got a call during breakfast from the head of our department last night saying there was a power outage in the bio building last night, and our backup generators ran out of fucking fuel.
So MEDIUM HYPE.

Woody can you have a woody hour every week?.
wait i thought that was woody cooking pigs in a blanket.
That foot though.
You can get pics of the house when it is setup.
I had a great lazy sunday.
Here is a foot.
Wonderful! You should send pics of the new digs.
Right as always!.
Did I have a good day #?.
Dragos, I hope your day has been splendid too.
Dragos Knight.
#who else?.
Andy, I hope you've had a wonderful Sunday .
It was the woody hour.
Lots of woody messages .
This is all I want in life. .
You'll get my rants and nothing more. Sometimes mike gets actual food.
I'd throw in 20 bucks.
woody should do a kickstarter.
It would be like chopped but with more puns and Woody's ugly mug.
Can I fund this.
Too risky. Gotta put yourself out there, the potential ridicule is too high. Who am I to brave critique from my peers?.
#youwont.
do it.
If I had a go pro I would make a cooking YouTube series. And it would be great.
No truer words have ever been spoken.
Dry chicken just fucking blows.
This is a masters level rant.
Goddamn numbers in the mix more.
165 is ridiculous! Just hold the temp at 150 for like 2 min. Boom. Safe and not bone dry.
Got the graph, safe food temp is a function of time.
Along those lines, FDA safe temperatures are a joke. It's way over cooking things.
Just don't overcook it.
You can't seal in juice. You can anything juiciness.
Meet juiciness? It's just how well cooked it is. Full stop.
Woody I've never needed anything more.
I've got more. Mostly around meats.
Milk is not a substitute .
Next time you go the store, buy cream. Throw some in basically everything. Amazing.
All the great food you have in restaurants? It's butter, salt, cream.
People forget about cream.
Woody more food rants.

Good on you I say.
And then made pizza.
They heard rumor someone invented the salad and just laughed and laughed.
Italians figured food out. Pasta, grease, cheese, tomatoes.
That is a good way to combat the rising obesity epidemic in a family oriented and sustainable manner. .
Yeah. She cooks very healthy meals and always encourages outdoor activities.
your mother can perpetuate healthy activites #gotem.

It's pretty cool that sUN was created to perpetuate a sedentary activity that is/was done at unhealthy levels by most of us, and now she can perpetuate healthy activities..

In Texas they literally don't have booths, they just scan your plates and send you a bill at the end of the month. .
I felt uncomfortable when I ran that toll until I realized it would cost more for them to mail me a bill and then me mail it back.
Will report results.
I was going to sass but that sounds workable.
Go to a drive thru and get change?.
Maps told be there was a toll. No information beyond that.
Going to kitty hawk.
What toll is it?.
That seems aggressive.
Run toll booth.
Answer: you don't .
I had this happen to me last week.
Serious question.
Where the fuck do I get change for toll booths at 11pm or in the morning.

Yes, but liz is yelling at me so later.
Or whatever word should be there.
So we can use #quien.
Andy can you translate all the names to lousy spanish.
Huh well there you go.
^fucking right.
Story checks out.
Andy Esposito.
#who is clever?.
But estoy listo means I am done.
Soy listo means I am clever.
It means clever with ser.
Latin proves to be less helpful than expected.
Which takes a different meaning if you use the word ser.
Welp I guessed.
Listo is the word.
".
Estas finito?.
Also, "are you done" is a great time to use estas.
Ok.
You done yet.
Now you know.
Mike es un idiota.
For example: mike is an idiot.
>permanent shit.
But for permanent shit you would use ser.
You would say estoy frio.
Like I am cold.
Estar is for temporary states.
But also there is more than one "is" word on spanish. Ser and estar..
So if estar was the right verb it would be esta not estas.
First of all, its the you singular conjugation.
omg cant w8.
Im gonna explain estas right now and why its so wrong in this context.
sooner or later i'll manage to give andy an aneurysm with my take on the spanish language.
Why would you not put the question mark at the start of the sentence?.

i guess we could roll on ja ja's for things.

Quitting because you lose at dota is worse than quitting dota because it made you a loser. .
Do more cockmagic with us.
Maybe I'll just quit dota like the rest of you.

i don't know what it's like in whitewashed Canada, but here, we have multicultural experiences and laughter..
Maybe just have the "fuck Andy" response at a really low probability.
But like, how often are we going to laugh in Spanish?.
im sure that wont grow old really fast.

Mike, I bike all the time.
ok im in again.
We ride.
im just a man.
i aint fuckin jesus.
stu dont you fuckin follow me.
it would also be difficult to bike like a concord jet, but that's more due to aerodynamics than anything else.
it would literally be more difficult to bike a 9 minute mile..
another time that I was a concord jet.
once it thought I was driving.
I run so fast it thinks I'm biking.
also ez non competition nobody else bikes.
Strava itself is 10/10. Numbers so cool. I can bitch about why certain hills sucked so much. 10% grade for a mile blows.

I'll use it to run in the morning .
But haven't used it. I downloaded  it when mike takes about it.
well, chip chop. Gets to testing.
I have one.
Need Mike so he can confirm it works, he's the only other person with a Strava account I think.
Thank you.
This will actually make me run.
Well done.
So now we're going to compete?.
I'll run faster tomorrow so I can brag about it.

I'm almost home. Let's do things.
omg. Brian. The light of my life. You're back. .
So what are some thing things I missed? Woody married, cam OD'ed on yayo, Jon didn't have any money?.
For running.
Jon, use Strava.
It'd be hilarious if sun did new records for running and lifting. Also new lows, Jon hasn't run in 8 days, a new low!.

Hi guys :).
Orishas are a cuban rap group, manu chao is french, spanish and english, and jarbe de palo I think is spanish but I'm not sure.
Orishas, manu chao, and jarbe de palo were my contributions.
Get*.
Hey hyped, new major feature coming tonight.
Is that a playlist Andy...?.
Naw.
Have you listened to las orishas yet?.
The playlist just went from rap to the national. I'm confused. .
thats cause my deck is better than andys.
agreed im rank 5  and i barely play .
If my day job was playing video games I could get legendary.
Honestly rank just means you play a lot.
She's not that good.
Much like dragos.
Attractive..
for group me reference .
she might be dead inside tho.
shes rank 3 .
is this girl any good at hearthstone or is she just hot?.
jon watch legendary lea stream hearthstone; shes super annoying but hot.

Jajajaja.
*Bandy.
is it ban Andy? I hope its ban Andy.
I'll take care of this situation, with a compromise we can all enjoy. .
just increase the max # of ja's as is.
as in.
I meant just have it stop so there's no infinity.
sorry, I realize the confusion.
and yet they still haven't....
i mean, I don't think it's a matter of whether they can do it?.
the self apology somehow makes it sadder.
>Relax, you're doing fine..
Sorry.
Much like my love life.
andy, that was cold..
stu, if mike and woody can't do it then, no offense, its probably out of your league.
unless you add a conditional.
it would probably crash the groupme anyway after sun rolled 20 heads in a row.
Thank you. .
nice self like mike.
Andy you argue worse than drunk you.
if you cant do it then whatever, you did the business side not the coding side, this kind of thing isnt even your job anymore.
I'm sorry Andy I don't see race.
Andy - this reverse logic won't work. Do your own work.
wtf is that mike - its "BA BADA BAAAAAAA".
well until you guys finish jerking each other off and put it in, color me skeptical.

don't forget about merry matt!.
Me Woody and JOHN CENA.
#gif tag team.
bam. Mike and me, the amazing tag team.
That is literally the implementation. .
implement and lets see.
While (random.choice([0,1])): out += "ja".
it is. Mike confirm....
i dont know enough about coding to say that your operation is complete.
can confirm, that is only one line.
and it has to stop at tails.
but it only rerolls if its heads.
It was 1 line.
Isn't that it?.
While(random is heads) { print "ja"}.
^not so easy.
we kill the batman.
but then you actually think about it.
it sounds simple.
i think implementing it is harder than you think.
Then you fucked up.
i tried to come up with what the programming might look like (but with syntax I'm only guessing at) however it gets too complicated too quick.
Andy, go. Do it. Chop chop.
the amount of ja's would be ja*2^(# of heads).
^i fucked that up.
basically you are asking her to flip a coin until she gets tails and then add a "ja" for each heads she got.
coding sUN to do that might be complicated though.
so the average amount of jajas is infinite, but there is also a very low likelihood of rolling a very high number.
which is infinite.
which simplifies to 1+1+1+1.....
so 2*.5+4*.25+8*.125...+x*(1/x).
to get the average you would add the probability of each number occurring by the chance it occurs.
jajajajaja.
i'd like to go back the the jaja in series thing and point out that i was right about that.
I like 'but I so like' better.
*do like.
I'm not a huge fan, but I so like the song criminal.
Yeah she's pretty cool. I don't listen to her a whole lot, but I don't turn her off when she comes on.
Matt do you like fionna apple? I feel like a lot of the songs you like involve female singers with kinda deeper voices.
thanks scrandy.
For Canada I dont even have 6.5 seconds.

You still arent.
You werent even your own country yet matt.
We burned down your whitehouse in 1814.
is matt right #?.
I don't know enough about history to refute you matt.
Fuck, why cant I remember this.
I think.
Its 50% every time to add another ja, and whenever you do get another ja you roll again for another ja.
the great maple revolution of ehhh-teen ehh-tee fore.
hold. beer and fresh cuts?.
we smoked you dummies.
1812.
what war were canadians in.
Hi.
Also, Jon, I love barber shops. I always go to this one when I'm back home that's run by a bunch of war vets. You get a beer when you walk in and then you get to sit down, get a fresh cut, and listen to stories about the war. Shit is tight..
Oh I remember how it works now.
you can't even remember your wallet, how the fuck did you pass finance.
Well then I remembered my finance class wrong.
oh, Jan's here..
whatchu got there numbers?.
no it isnt.
Because of how series work.
Because technically the average amount of jaja will be infinite.
You should make it so that it has a 50% chance to spit out 2, 25% for 4, 12.5% for 8, etc....
sty pls dont die.
its like having 2 die.
the old gods still hold immense power.
you're going to look down on kobe.
this is a new couinting mechanism.
random between 4 and 8 IIRC.
mike, you've outdone yourself.
jajajajajajajaja.
Is it a random amount of jajaja?.
woah! there's a random amount of 'ja's in that response.
whats the max ja's she can spit?.
jajajaja.
jajaja.
jajajajajajaja.
jajaja.
or the spanish language.
"guiz seriously court iz srs".
i'm imagining andy is sitting at his desk seriously concerned that we don't take the judicial system seriously.
or does he belong to you?.
you do belong to zeus.

We're in a polytheism over here.
I feel the need to reiterate that whether it be in state or federal court, a judge can in fact judge you.
careful now matt.
infinite loops.
i dont understand.
sUN == god.
sUN > friends > mother > god.
it should be like.
and maybe my mother but i ignore like 75% of what she says.
And a judge.
only god can judge me. and sUN. and my friends..
His friends.
who are we to judge what he likes?.
he could like nasty things and still enjoy life.
high af on life.
He's enjoying life.
Thats a compliment.
It means he likes nice things.
> what hell.
>you like nice today.
not gonna lie, the j a j a j a j a j a j a is my favorite and least technically difficult feature yet.
:tacotaco: you like nice today mike.
maybe i need a self esteem boost while gorging myself on mexican food.
No matt, a taco that give you compliments.
a complimentary taco would be one that tells you you look nice.
if i had meant complementary, i would have written that..
*complementary.
i just wish more things in my life also came with a complimentary taco.
the fact that a taco comes with that response is so damn funny.
jajajajajaja.

"only_eats_farts".
bighomo_69_dickinmybutt.
you can guess my username.
kay I'm on last.fm too.
hmm interesting.
also i can't spell reccomendations for shit.
if we include last.fm, it could make reccomendations from songs you've never even heard.
I'll leave this is your able hands, Moke.
me neither.
i dont really understand how spotify works with the concept of a "library"..
fuck..
You will play: Io.
or how about a #next one too where it tosses a random song from your library at you? or is that too much work?.
unsure about how it will work.
either the song you're currently listening to, or maybe the last one you listened to.
english122 on last.fm.
I'm connected.
so # nowplaying will post a link to the song on spotify we are currently listening to|.
I too, will do it.
Just remembered I had last.fm since 2009.
I'll do it.
thanks for nothing, spatifay.
update: it doesn't seem directly possible to implement a # nowplaying unless you all sign up for a last.fm account and link that to your spotify.

.
Ok need ideas for how to use Spotify API. What about a #nowplaying.
we sort like to tinkle on the blower from time to time.
Did you know "we sort" is a group of people. The we sort.
These dudes are artists. Meticulous and really talented. Its actually very impressive. .
Not just black people. All sorts. .
...black people?.
I love this barbershop so fuckin much. Such a great dip into people I usually don't get to meet. Great environment. .
Did not expect it, delightfully surprised. .
Favorite moment so far, one black dudes ringtone is the pokemon theme when you first enter a fight. .
Sun you sassy minx.
no argument there. .
Cam.
#who looks worst?.
no argument there. .

#who looks best in a suit.

Oh no its raining, the call go un noticed.
Does gondor call for aid?.
ANDY TO HELMSDEEP.
So this is it. The great battle if our age. .
I've got my black vocabulary hat on since I'm in the barbershop. .
Not liking a show and it being bad are different.
That diss track was so fucking weak.
woody throwing shade .
Meek Mill is also bad.
Wait so this is it? This is the great battle of our age.
^false.
Bojack is bad.
Which is really all I want in life.
And I love all of it.
Its teeters between super corny animal puns and depressingly dark moments.
Not gonna lie, did not enjoy. .
I like it.
I need to finish the 2nd season.
>that was uncalled for, but a lot of fun to watch.
Uncalled for .
> Sorry..
Wtf Andy why would you say that.
Liz hates you.
Look if Liz hates me you can come out and say it.
Word, I now dont have to convince liz to show up at a party with someone she hates there .
!!!.
I've actually already talked with her about not going.
that's my boy mike, take notes .
I'm going to the beach this weekend so I cannot come up to DC and disappoint your friend.
Something went wrong.
#gif penis take the wheel.
Go there just to take a dump in their bathroom and peace out mike. .
High steaks.
Jon. Yes. Terrible. The Drake one back to back was pretty nice .
The catch is you cannot stay at my place.
Speaking of, courtey wants you to come up to dc to come to a party her and rachel are throwing tonight.
Andy if I've learned anything from you, it's that persistence makes things funny. Or maybe that alcohol makes you cool. Unsure. .

is the me-me a soft e, or like mee-mee?.
Hey Jon, first time caller, long time listener. I wonder if you could let us know what sort of dunks are the most disrespectful. I'll take my answer off the air. .
Welcome to Jon's GroupMe hour by the way .
At the barbershop and I noticed everyone here says meme as 'me-me' .
Also Ronnie, that meek diss track? So awful.
Pretty funny. Lots of famous people. The plot sometimes gets too dumb for even a dumb comedy mood. .
I watched that Amy Poehler show Wet Hot American Summer show on Netflix last night too. .
http://i.imgur.com/cjjKudg.gif.
Also, this.
also, people who were signing up didn't know it would be public information which could have changed their decision..
There's a bunch of valid stuff there. The point about robbers knowing about what houses don't have firearms was the best point I think. .
http://gawker.com/5971218/newspaper-publishes-names-addresses-of-local-gun-permit-holders-some-people-have-a-problem-with-this.
Explain .
the New York database of who owned a gun went over SUPER poorly.
Yea I don't think I would want.
I'm sure there's a bunch of logistics that wouldn't fly but the idea was cool, it involved a GPS location and a notification of when the firearm was used. Bunch of other stuff. .
I remember I was in some class that brought up digital identification of firearms. Seemed like a good idea. .
You can also scratch off the ID number.
I think so, or the numbers are filed off so its impossible to know who it WAS registered too.
Or does unregistered explicitly mean that the state / people didn't even know the gun existed .
So when news claim a weapon as unregistered though, do they sometimes gloss over the fact that it might be registered but under someone else's name. .
My dad had a rifle stolen that was used in a shootout with police. It was "licensed" to him so the cops came a knocking but just gave him the gun back.
^ reported.
I have an unregistered car right now.
like unregistered vehicles, they just change hands without anyone knowing.
Guns get stolen / lost.
Background checks only came about after an attack on the president.

Well any laws or regulations on the gun industry are super hard to pass.
I'm sure there's so many that they can't keep track but, still seems like a crazy thing to not be diligent about. .
Pretty insane. What's the procedure between big gun manufactures and people they sell to? Shouldn't the government just look at each gun coming out of those places? Again, these are questions that I simply have never asked or looked up. .
There are more guns than cars in this country, quite a few arent registered.
Back alley deals .
Shouldn't guns be tagged to owners upon purchase? Or whatever .
You buy it from someone sketchy.
This might be a dumb question but how does one have a non-registered weapon. .
did we #?.
you all saw it.
I'm a music legend now.
haha I feel so cool.
Thank you.

Spotify dragos. .
but are too lazy to go discover new things.
it's more, we all like music.
just add good stuff you like.
i want to add songs .... what .... how ? .
Woody likes his booty-bouncin-beats.
This asap song is pretty dope .
I like them woody..
that's going to be super cool to watch. USA vs USA.
coL vs. EG in the first stage of the main event.
I don't think anyone is going to like my adds, and they don't match anything else.
Done - Added my first song.
I just put in the music that other people probably wouldn't have heard because otherwise whats the point. Mike put in cascada though so I'm not sure what the rule is.
help please.
Or is it like a humble brag that I know the best stuff?.
or good stuff?.
do we add whatever?.
I don't understand this playlist.
Capriotti's thanksgiving bobby sandwich .
I know I missed this sandwich conversation but these reddit answers are weak. It's all in the details and these 4 word answers aren't doing it.
Yeah it seems shady.
Not because we're good people, because if Apple found out an banned your developer account we would be in deep shit.
Yea, we don't do it though. .
Is that a thing?.
Look them straight in the eye, let out your loudest and stinkiest fart (assert dominance), yell a loud noise and storm out of the room. They'll get the picture..
Meh, we'll just pay like 10,000 people in India to review it.

what's the standard unit of bitterness?.

Woody, before you go to work, do a shot of whiskey for luck.
order it medium rare, and also make sure it's at mouth level..
going all in?.
Today is a high stakes day.
Hey everyone, hope your Friday is going well.
Glad you're up to speed matt. Welcome..
Just to make sure it's what you had envisioned.
I'll end up sending you a promiscuous photo of myself when im getting fitted regardless.
I think two button is ok, barely different from one.
rent is nice because you can get fit and order it where you are, pick up in baltimore, and return anywhere.
I haven't looked yet but I decided that i'd rent instead of buying like I had originally intended.
remember sandy wang? classic lower school at tower hill..
two button no satin is common, I think there's a vera wang one that both places have.
i couldn't find a one button no satin at jos. a banks or mens wearhouse.
Classic Woody, being special, unique, and valuable.
Is that tux really that unique? I tried to pick out a pretty regular one.
Nice!.
Woody is cool..
Owned.
although any sandwich woody makes is probably more delicious.
if you are in Fairfax, you should try it.
yours sounds cooler..
this is true..
it's the same number of animals as your sandwich?.
nice..
think about all the things that died to make that sandwich possible.
with birch beer.
jesus christ.
fresh pickle of course.
Roast beef, corned beef, ham & pastrami with Russian, slaw, cheddar cheese and chopped liver on Rye.

andy is the white power, ranger.
And Andy gets white neon.
Wait can we do a power rangers thing? Then Woody gets to be red neon ranger.
Also I too need to buy that tux..
WE LOVE YOU MIKE!.
it also has to have woody's face screenprinted.
I call pink.
but with a leopard print.
any neon.
yea, it's all black but the codpiece is neon.
if we're gonna match, we obviously all need to buy matching silk boxers.
So what are we matching on? Codpieces?.
one-button, notched lapel, no satin.
he will lead you to a grain elevator.
then you must give the password.
first you have to arrive at the old barn at midnight.
the tux woody described is a special snowflake.
yea, it's a little more complex though.
You can sometimes buy one for like $100.
are you guys going to rent?.
i did some research yesterday.
where does one buy a tux?.
and i still need to buy mine.
tuxes.
Also where did we land on suits for woodys wedding.
also, good luck.
good look on your interview!!.
Man, I look really good in a suit. That's your Mike update for the day. .
cyka.
I could add some Russian but I'm also lazy.
No. Unlike everything else this group stands for, the playlist us SERIOUS BUSINESS. .
cyka.
if sUN is bilingual now, when will she learn her native tongue?.
because i feel like thats whats appropriate.
also, i'm only adding weird music i like to this playlist.
and i dont need it anymore.
jajajajajaja.
Jajajaja.
i got it canceled.
Leah, did you replace your government credit card yet.
twist.
Andy was a girl the whole time.
hola.
Hi leah.
i'm using my friend's account.

i want to add my favorite spanish language song.

Dr who is 80% weird British silliness for 20% great TV.
Yessss Jan is adding to your playlist stu.
I haven't watched much of the new ones.
that one is fun.
Stu. I watched the Van Gogh Dr. Who episode for the first time last night. Pretty good..

I would sass you, but you unfucked my mistakes today. .
I'm gonna add bad stuff to fuck up the shuffle .
Its like the laziest way to get a mainline of decent music.
I'm going to listen to this all day at work.
I like that it tells you who put each song on the list. .
Lake Street Dive! mah man!.
The whole album Shrines is great start to finish.
It's gonna be at like 300 songs before the weekend is out.
only did two songs though!.
right now I'm enjoying them.
sty, you're big in to purity ring I see.
this playlist fucking rules already.
Ok I won't add the pirates of the Caribbean theme song.
everything I add I like, but I intend to infuriate you until your musical horizons expand.
just did a good go through, tried to keep some kind of theme. there are some songs that will stick out.
This is going to be the best and worst playlist ever. .
my goal is to add the least cohesive pile of golden musical shit.
- tree beard .
Release the river .
Noooo do ittttt.
Added a few, stopped myself before I released the floodgates.
yeaaaaa.
Matt can you add songs to sUN?.
Sam is the kind of guy you say "he's great, love him" but then every other detail and story you tell about him makes him sound awful.
Sam. What a name. .
rich girl reminds me of sam bissell and third year, which means it makes me a little happy and makes my liver hurt.
Ducktales aired in 1987, this song came out in 1980. It's a total ripoff.
rich girl best song.
holland oates is one of the 20th century's greatest artists.
i can think of nothing but "500 days of summer" when i hear that song.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_I4wtNPv5w.
the ducktales theme sounds so much like this.
yeee boi.
ya dig.
and we can collab.
you can add that playlist.
I think with that link.
also I did the thing.
https://open.spotify.com/user/ssteen3/playlist/3k5C1H7z9uVF3vLhzok1fL.
oo-OOO-oo.
that theme song is fuckin dopest dope ive ever smoked .
https://youtu.be/CMU2NwaaXEA.

i preferred the book more than the tv show.
I liked the TV show.
Matt you'd prob like them.
They're pretty groovy.
Has anyone heard ducktails?.
except for woody, fuck that guy.
everyone loves their own brew.
delightful.
How's your own fart smell matt?.
When I first heard this band I had a classic case of 'not sure if this is crap or not' but I'm so in to this album right now. Her voice is so rough and raspy and cool, plus the band is tight as heck.

Eli is pretty white.
He grew less white. Andy wins now. .
You've never met Tyler Lassen.
I've realized the problem.
andy has - for years- won the "who is our whitest friend" competition. i had dropped it because, honestly, it was starting to get a little mean. i regret that, in this instance, funny has again outweighed how much i care about being mean.
shit.
I have been bested.
Damnit Andy. I didn't want to bring this up again but having a picture of yourself with George Bush senior? That's the whitest thing ever. .

I still wanna get a desktop this year. I will be consulting this group/obviously building it.

I'll probably wait for a little bit before upgrading.

Woody's 1% brought her back to life with a sassy Spanish flair.
Im happy to give you 100% credit.
Mikes 99% killed sun.
obviously the important 1% though.
Mike with 99% of the work here, I got the last 1%.
Mikes earlier question makes more sense now.

Right as always.

Wait wtf, eg picked techies?.
She must have the nicest smile.
Also, she went to school at a toothpaste factory?.
Fine. Butt stuff it is .
She's in Hawaii for a year teaching at a charter school. .
Take Woody's advice.
May I recommend butt stuff?.
Just bang her out an move on. Lets gooooo alreaaady.
No. The girl lives nearby. She graduated from Colgate but is moving to Hawaii soon. She wants to meet before she leaves, which is cool. Talked to her a bunch the past three days, seems chill. I'll probably meet her and tell the group elaborate details of the experience. .
Overall 9/10 would recommend.
Also, I met a girl off tinder. We had a thing for like two months but soon found out we didn't have anything in common and there wasn't much beside a superficial attraction.
Wait, jon, are you going to hawaii?.
Kidding. I'm done. No more thinking. g2g.
what about 2 fires.
I won't. Not even if there was a fire. .

probably pack your bags.
Mostly likely a positive reaction so plan for that.
Jon fart in front of her. Depending on her reaction, you should move to Hawaii with her .
CDEC v. EG about to start. These two have looked really good .
TF2! TF2! who wants to play tonight?! EVERYONE.
you should eat a lot of cheese just before you meet her.
She's moving to Hawaii august 17th. She's cool so I probably will meet her regardless. .
Girl from tinder wants to meet sometime. Uncharted territory. .

You could just leave the dota barebones.
and whatever else comes in the pipeline.
Oh.
groupme ids, steam ids, dota ids.
no, sUN would still be sUN, but our personal details would be ocontained outside of the github repo.
So you'd basically just create a parallel generic version of sun?.
i've considered it, but the codebase needs to be sanitized of our personal details.

Remember when woody was like, "your laugh sounds like it belongs in a horror movie" to that girl last weekend. .
he'll shatter.
ask*.
and ash him "Did you get new deodorant?".
3 days tops.
then wait.
but murmer "Ah, it kinda does smell like you".
play it cool, look a bit ashamed.
when he explains its his food.
ask loudly "What is that smell?!".
shatter his confidence.
Here's what I would do, all jokes aside.
In a bad mood.
Woofy is very murdery today.
then vomit on his keyboard.
no success.
#kill boris.
oh.
kill him.
make gagging noises.
when the coworker says it's his food.
ask loudly who farted.
Good morning ladies.
it smells fucking terrible in here..
a fish tryna get some pussy..
my coworker is microwaving what must be a fish wearing fish cologne. who the fuck does that.

That leads to my anus .
New idea, stop making a website and make a treasure map.
>what hell.
actually, just make the whole header a series of riddles.
>off my anus.
I'm just putting the skeleton in.
Add a picture off my anus .
Replace all with roman gods and see if anyone gets it.
And put a saturn car instead of the planet.
replace neptune with a picture of the roman god.
just remove Neptune and sub in your company's logo and see if anyone notices.
No room for celestial dwarfs.
web formatting is 10/10 hard.
Either way make sure you cut off pluto.
Not sure which looks better.
Also put the wording in line with the planets and then put the logo either after neptune or after the wording.
Distances between planets arent to scale 2/10.

Sty does your lab have a website?.
I can FEEL the texture.
I'm digging the leather header.
yea the site is pretty good.
You did it!.
(I made a computer joke).
whatyearisit dot gif.
Its not flash based so i assume it sucks.
And yeah, I use R for manipulating data and graphing. I'm fluent enough with the language to do basic data tidying and manipulation.
It gets the job done, but could be a bit more sleek.
honestly for a research website, that seems just fine. might need some updating for recent information, but seems fine.
http://mallorylab.coffeecup.com/.
We already have a lab research website, but one girl in my lab wants to make a new one because ours at the moment is pretty dated.
http://media.giphy.com/media/Y2nbrJyAR6RiM/giphy.gif.
Btw stu, or in spanish is just "o".
or not even just one raw data file, but a hundred data files from similar measurements.
i mostly use it for data processsing... "i have this raw data, and that's neat, but i want to manipulate it a thousand complicated ways and look at graphs of it".
or por que no los dos.
and then you can do python.
that will make you learn at least some html.
matt, make a website for your research group.
i'm mostly self taught, at least where it counts.
http://learnpythonthehardway.org/.
I wish someone told me during my undergrad how important coding is and encouraged me to take some courses. That's my biggest regret from my undergrad.
Hmmm.
you literally already have python on your computer andy.
*a good.
python bb.
Im also good at sudoku. Whats an good beginner coding language?.
"here's what i have, and here's what i want out of it".
i mean, there's learning the language and syntax which is its task, but it's just iterative problem solving.
Also, the only coding experience I have is with R and I'm self-taught so I'm pretty helpless.
I rock at sudokus but suck at coding.
you know the part of a sudoku when you've got enough filled out that you're just kind of following the rules to fill out the rest of the puzzle? that's almost literally what coding is..
so, yes, you can.
Well, with my limited knowledge of anything related to coding or programming, I fully believe that you and Woody are geniuses who can make a computer program become self-aware and self-sustaining.
but im not here to ask if we should, i'm here to ask if we can.

my working strategy for music has almost always been to have friends who can find new music.
I like music but I'm lazy. You guys doing this seems like a good way to leverage these facts.
it's a really simple/powerful feature.
yea.
i guess? we could all dump music onto it and sUN could do things with it.
you can make collaborative playlists?.
because we could leverage the fuck out of that.
q: does spotify support some sort of 'group' concept.
Here is the only serious music recommendation I'm gonna probably ever give in this group. Manu Chao, Clandestino.
i liked worlds, i haven't listened to much more of porter robinson.
if you like porter robinson, you'll probs like it.
this is neat.
it's kawaii.
as long as that's not like, toby keith or death metal, i'm probably game for it.
this probably isn't close to what you're looking for, but I started listening to kero kero bonito recently.
But after looking in to more of their stuff they're an amazing group.
I've been listening to a lot of Blur lately. I didn't think much of them because all I knew was "Song 2" and I thought (and still think) that song sucks.
listen to it.
http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/339/break-up.
this was an awesome This American Life that had phil collins in it.
Christy, take off your robe..
don't just stare at it.
Genesis are fucking awesome.
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I didn't really understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. Touch was the groups masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. .
if for nothing else than respect for jan.
i'm honestly amazed, at this point, that you haven't listened to any of her music matt..
I honestly don't know any of her music, and I'm ok with that.
i'm on good old war's newest right now, but it's feeling a bit downbeat.
what are you feeling?.
i might be slowpoking, but i was recently introduced to that "popular" song her and mika did. that's nice..
She's great. .
Ariana Grande, am I right?.
and by someone, i probably mean matt or stu.
someone give me an album reccomendation.
Kung fu grip engage.
I'm having a great day.
Apparently matt's about to get a robo handy from sUN dressed as a waitress.
What a time to be alive.
Monogamous robots. Who would have thought. .
sUN are you a pleasurebot only for Matthew #?.
will you make me a sandwich #?.
Roleplaying I see.

#what type of pleasure do you provide?.
Mah girl!.
sUN, are you a pleasurebot #?.
Well there's your problem.
sUN are you a killbot#?.
Back to the lab.
Also, wut?.
Rats. Still alive.
Eg is da bomb matt. You just be hating.
#kill Andy.
dats cuz eg suk.
Eg's early game went pretty poorly that game.
Pulling def helped.
Well he still ~~lost mid but it wasn't a winnable matchup anyways.
It gives your mid such a huge advantage.
I think I'd seen a video about pulling mid but crazy to see it in a real game.
yea thought that was cool.
^pretty neat.
matt don't worry, reading isn't all that's it's quacked up to be.

#what do canadians use to travel.
sUN aint no punk ass bitch.
did I #?.
You made that word up.
We created Bombardier.
but just... idk.
you guys even have bombardier.
sty omg.
for some reason I always assumed driving was the only way.
Sick!.
I understand that reference Andy!.
matt I never considered until now that I could fly to canada.
And matt, I dont travel north of the wall.
It is a very good pun. .
It did, but then I took it seriously.
andy, I'm not sure if your 3rd world country comment had that pun intentionally, but I accept.
Just come visit Northern Canada! With the USD doing so well, and the CAD doing so poorly, you guys can explore the True North Strong and Free for a very low price!.
I just wanted to dump on the American Midwest, but it's good to know you've considered a trip to Uganda.
They should have hired me for marketing, i think they're looking at the wrong demographics.
If you're not jerking off on your smart phone, what else is there to do in gary indianna? I said traveling in third world countries because a) you're probably busy doing other shit so you wont want to play candy crush b) there wont be a great network so smartphones are less useful c) you wont always have a place to charge your phone, so the longer battery life will be useful.
Or just Gary Indiana.
I guess if I was traveling in a 3rd world country for an extended period of time it would be nice. Otherwise I'm pretty sure they dropped the ball.
they're treading a fine line between functionality and endurance.
I think their sole consumers will be friends and family.
Will anyone be able to foot the bill for these phones?.
They need to step up their game.
Cant put a price on footsteps.
But its got a pedometer!!!.
Alternatively a calculator that can text.
It just a phone with less features.
After a second read, I think you're right Moke. Still, not something id invest in.
I thought it was largely tongue in cheek. Just being sardonic about how their device isn't "smart.".
absolutely.
We're already getting really efficient with batteries.
I think there totally is a market for phones and portable electronics with greatly increased battery lives, but to have a unique product totally centred around that seems like it will be obsolete soon.
yea mostly the long ass standby time.
yea but fitness.
The Janos One seems useful to a degree, but I don't think it's revolutionary. The whole "it's a pedometer too" is totally irrelevant.

Thanks Moke, lookin good over there! Lots of celebrity gossip to catch up on this week. 1st off, or should I say third?! Three merlinis have made an appearance on the Dota2 scene! People are wondering where merlini got his manta style, and he sure uses it with style! Dota analysis just got three times more handsome, and we couldn't be happier!.

I think it's just been bread into them.
ducks...what are they quacking about?.

Batter or no?.

You wouldn't even know how to deep fry a sock, much less eat one.

Get on my level.

I'm imagining you in shorts too Jon.
Ehome picked Luna against eg. .
I'm listening to that song suit and tie by Justin Timberlake right now too.
They have to get to the finals to get 2nd.
Little suit and tie.
I'm having a lot of fun imagining Jon as a sportscaster. .
C9 undefeated today, can't explain that.
Thanks mike, in sports today LGD splits its series with Secret. Strong showing from RTZ, looking like the top player in the tournament as many expected. .
Which is super important .
Yea they're being very levelheaded.
Most of these suits normally sound preposterous.
$215k/defendant doesn't seem unreasonable to me.

I dunno who the caster is, but he was going nuts during that final fight.
1) jan wat, 2) everyone is almost always cool with going midas on almost everyone situationally, 3) maelstrom + treads + pms = poor man's antimage..
'PIGS DON'T LET PEOPLE LIVE, PIGS HELP PEOPLE EAT'.
Here's my theory on midas in pro games. Every player likes going midas but no player wants to get blamed for going midas. Therefore they wait until midas is accepted on some hero and then choose to go it most games on that hero regardless of whether it makes sense..
it was stupid that you could basically run a position 1 jungle. i'm still upset that nobody going maelstrom over midas on him. you farm outrageously fast..
im so sad that, if i ever play doto again, he's going to be nerfed into the fucking pavement.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ jan yes.
that hero is so stupid..
did you see that Bloodseeker in the Fnatic Na'vi game mike.
I feel like if you just make it a low probability event it would work well.

I remember when iceiceice was in one of his old teams, he wanted to draft and wasn't ever able to. The captain gave him the chance once, iceiceice doesn't ban a single hero, drafts a team and stomps the other guys.
That strat would be more legit if you could just pass. Otherwise you use up all your pick time.
Did you ever see the "no-ban-strat" game?.
...I'm watching, wtf?.
C9 just did a disrespectful no-ban in their last pick against IG.
NaVi got STOMPED in the laning stage but Dendi was like 'long hair dont care' and just rekt them.
Jesus.
Dendi just went 20-0-15 as QoP vs FNATIC.

Hey, Andy Esposito:  3spooky5me.
Dark stuff .
I have a buddy who swears he's not going to speak to his kids for the first 5 years and then start talking to them out of the blue just to mess with them.
I met a kid yesterday who grew up in a cult until he was 12.
Also they are funny.
Kids are great. Slave labor.
i.e. she's a whore.
"she's full of spunk".
Describing someone as spunky could be complimentary or gross.
spunk is a funny word.
just donate your spunk to a sperm bank so that you have descendants without all the hassle of raising / caring for them.
looks like we've got another mystery on our hands!.
Andy hates kids and Liz hates Andy .
I'll play it by ear.
not with that attitude!.
Im not even sure I'll have descendants.
Refer to earlier comment about understanding math.
im not so sure any descendants of andy's are going to be great.
I was about to say you're wrong but then math and you're likely right.
You've actually probably nailed it on the 40 generations / 1000 years thing.
And neither did my great^40 grandchildren.
I didnt want that reminder anyway.
4andy.
andyandyandyandy.
andyyyyyyyyyyyyy.
Shit.
#remind me "1000 years" thats not how relativity works.
ha jokes on you, the system rejects reminders about the past.
#remindme "yesterday" Time is relative.
I will remind Andy Esposito about  3spooky5me. Beep boop..
#remindme "1 second" 3spooky5me.
sUN actually parsed that one correctly. you will be receiving that notification..
I will remind sty about  you are one billion seconds old. Beep boop..
#remindme "10:16:40 PM, October 28, 2022" you are one billion seconds old.
see? math is crazy hard..
October 2023.
Also its closer to 8.
math is hard though.
Hence the question.
Im aware of how math works.
jfc that's 9 years andy..
I will remind Andy Esposito about  does this thing still exist?. Beep boop..
#remindme "3000 days" does this thing still exist?.
that was already on the list, you fool.
I will remind Woody Zantzinger about  ding dong get married time . Beep boop..
#remindme "52 days" ding dong get married time .
Oh well.
Its 148.
I fucked that up.
I will remind Andy Esposito about  Merry Christmas!. Beep boop..
#remindme "145 days" Merry Christmas!.
I will remind Desrosiers about  blaze it. Beep boop..
#remindme "266 days" blaze it.
here's hoping, skintube.
And yes, my hippie socialist healthcare system would give me a cyborg leg, but I'm hoping I can keep my fleshy non-cyborg leg.
Good arrested development joke.
*can.
"We cab rebuild him...".
i just understood andy's joke. i feel like a fool..
is your socialist healthcare going to get you a sweet cyborg leg?.
Matt if they cant fix your leg, will you be all right?.

So we literally saved your left.

PPD is the man. I don't like when people call him fat. Cause that's mean..
Im not totally behind sumail yet, but the rest of eg is great.
Also the fact that ppd basically picked out both sumail and arteezy from NA dota inhouse games and made them into some of the best pros is pretty sick.

They kept taking shots at each other through the cast which was hilarious.
I remember watching him and Puppey cast a game during ESL1 (I think) and it was awesome to have the two rivals work together to cast a gamr.
He's just misunderstood.
Hes an amazing player and can be pretty funny, but a lot of the time he comes off as a prick.
Ppd is awesome. He's a genius drafter and his sense of humor is super dry and sarcastic.
But Aui is Canadian which is pretty tight.
*ppd.
Same with pod.
There's just something about EG I can't get behind. SumaiL is a little shit.
And Sonneiko is amazing to watch.
Secret are my boys but iceiceice is my fave player and seeing BigDaddys video made me root for C9.
With these player profiles I have no idea who to root for.
regardless though I'm rooting for EG all day.
would be so epic.
Watching EG? I hope its an EG v. Secret final .
Something went wrong.

Had a ten win arena run tonight. I'm much more comfortable with Priest over any other class. Just easier. .
Yeah the old men were discussing the benefits and short comings of the US style of, you're sick now we've got cool shit to fix you, style of healthcare. .
my stream keeps shitting out on this eg/vg game and i am not pleased.
thats my understanding anyway.
yeah youre right usually more socialized healthcare systems focus on prevention over high tech treatment of disease because it's cheaper .
Eventually it will trickle down to, I have a friend from Romania. .
But I remember when you were talking about how healthcare in Romania was more preventative in the sense that they monitor your health yearly (or whatever). Correct me if I'm wrong. I paraphrased my paraphrasing. .
youre right naked old women are better.
no. .
uh....
naked old men are the best right jon?.
Just sat in a sauna with old men who were talking about healthcare stuff. Used things I picked up from dragos, sounded like a baus  .
Most likely.

Go against the grain and send a butt pic .
Jon pls send dic pic and post results.
Gotta make a move Jon, I grow weary of this flirty game.

Idea: too many messages too fast during a workday and sun yells at us.
Fire burns up O2.
Yeah that's true Woody, but there still is 21.9% O2 in our breathable air.
Whatchu got there chemistry? .
omg mike..
yea but the air in a fire isn't completely CO2, its mostly nitrogen right? Isn't that what most of the air is?.
What's that in quarts.
if you inhale 2L of CO2 and you're O2 deprived, your lungs can't just extract the O2 from the CO2.
I'm pretty sure it is..
that isn't even close to how lungs work.
I'm not sure that's how lungs work, but I don't know enough to refute you.
You need something in lung to absorb CO2, even if there is no oxygen in the air.
don't need to do it at the surface.
you can exhale underwater.
Andy that's you're strategy for everything.
But the desire to breathe isn't caused by lack of oxygen, its amount of CO2, so exhaling would still work..
Ez mid.
I would just get naked.
Maybe you are fat boy.
you're sinking right to the bottom.
tuxedo you're toast.
If I fall in titanic style, I'd be fine drowning cause I got to slam on Kate Winslet for a week .
Tuxedo.
Could always get naked.
ok. are we naked in the water? or did we just fall in titanic style in a tuxedo?.
I'd pull a dolphin and get some hang time.
welp.
you'd take a big breath of CO2 and then be like.
all the oxygen would be burned up.
no because you'd be surfacing in to fire.
Could you surface, grab a breath, then immediately dive again to stop the burning.
I'd go with my poop strategy before taking the early gg and drowning. .
either way you're suffocating.
as you broke the surface, you'd also get covered with oil and then start to burn with no way to extinguish it.
Matt's strategy: try to set new personal best at breath holding.
Plus being wet could maybe buy me some time? Is there like a ledge here or is this an infinity pool.
If I knew I was gonna drown I'd swallow as much water as possible just to get it over with.
I would probably brave the fire. The water is certain death, the oil only likely.
Well Jon would die .
More like "blubblub".
I would take a poop in the water, hope that the chemical breakdown of the poop mixed with the oil would break it down enough that it would spread away in a hole big enough for me to surface. .
I'd probably mutter, "shit" first.
I like where this is going.
what would you do?.
and then someone spills oil on the surface and lights it up.
I'd probably pick water. Everyone else whose drowned can't be wrong right? I'm a follower.
say you're drowning.
I've heard drowning is pretty good.
>Well played!.
Sorry..
Your mother didn't seem to mind it.
fuck that shit.
i think being eaten would be the worst.
Also drowning might be the worst way to die. I think I fear being curbstomped more. .
I'd also enslave him like jafar in Aladdin .
If that doesnt work you can always wish for more genies.
I bet you'd get a genie and wish for more wishes. .
I'd like to drown in a tank of water that's also filled with gillyweed from harry potter. Eat some of the gilly weed and boom, easy not die.
Oh and she's electric!.
I said pussy :deal-with-it-dog:.
See jan.
my friends and I just went out for lunch and we got on the topic of drowning. The question came up, if we had to die by drowning, what would you choose to drown in?.
Drowning in the pussy.
4 chords 2 hard 4 me.
It's the classic "sounds-difficult-but-is-incredibly-easy" song.
Its the douchebags who only learn wonderwall on the guitars fault .
I agree with Matt's stigma analysis.
What's the story morning glory, roll with it awesome songs.
I agree. There seems to be a fair amount of stigma because of wonderwall but I sat at listened to that album today and its really good.
One of the better rock bands to come out of the 2000s.
It's a shame that Wonderwall has become a huge joke, but their other stuff is super cool.
I think they're great.

personally i think gyro is just gonna hit critical mass soon and then the game is gonna be over.
yeah, but they were ahead in that one.
the earthshaker is railing them in the ass each team fight.
'im just remembering the c9 sfz game that went on for ~forever when ee was on AM.
one amazing teamfight could put them back in it.
they've also have two fast farmers in the anti and lina. its possible to bring it back.
c9 is just trying to make space accross the map, and they're doing it pretty well.
its insane that this game is still going on..
> Relax, you're doing fine.
sorry..
you have enough free time to lose your wallet.
nerd!.
that thing took some serious time. i have less free time this summer.
remember last year when andy made that googledoc of the whole round robin? that was cool.
Secret just needs to go into a dimly lit room for a little while, listen to some Nora Jones and have a glass of wine. They'll be alright..
3 points for a 2-0 win, 1 point for a 1-1 series and no points for 0-2.
top 4 teams in each of the two groups at the end of the round robin advance to winners bracket.
>mike continues to think he knows things about brackets.
no, these are 2 game series.

lost to who, and now what happens.
secret lost, thats an upset.
*plays Eye of the Tiger*.
nvm..
i will bet you $0.25 on that jon.

razor's right clicks are pretty darn good if you get a long damage drain off.
c9 had so much utility but no proper right click to actually beat someone down.
ember kept surviving every fight and getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
thats what sing sing builds on ember (the blink not the linkens).
blinkens build was tight.
the blink of the ember.
>seppuku.
knew it.
razor did have an AC.
"let me link you... oh you're gone shoot".
unless you're going against someone like a bristle.
but he's pretty useless late game.
i guess razor has a little more lane presence, so he at least contributes in the early game.
slardar sucks.
i just think razor is like slardar- if you win a game with him, it's because of the other 4 heroes on your team.
cant explain that.
no i dont think so.
Didn't razor have an AC though?.
a shivas wouldve gone a long way.
maybe AC?.
you need something for attack speed.
dragos pls.
god a satanic refresher bkb rapier carry dazzul would be hilarious.

that was a great example of buying a rapier before the game was hopeless.

thats the key.
you have to go with the rhythem of the music woody.

Music gets in my head and I get all out of rhythm .
No music or tv for me. I'm with Andy.
I was also sworn to silence regarding the GoldenEye fact but that girl is awful so yolo.
it looks like it is rocking a pompadour .
^pretty lil thing.

brown eyes are a type of sex object.
#duckfacts.
Thanks matt.
Goldeneyes are a type of duck.
did you guild your dick and call it the golden gun?.
do you also ask the girl at the end if she had fun?.
I did get some action watching GoldenEye once. Would recommend. .
if your head isnt in the game then you're gonna do a piss poor job.
lil andy got adhd.
andy gotta focus to get ready.
music is okay, but i cant focus if there is something on screen.
i have to mute any tv or movie prior to sex.
it 100% is moke.
I don't think math is prepared to be used in this context.
weirdest movie i ever had sex to was V for Vendetta. I remember there's a scene where the Benny Hill theme is playing and it took me right out of the moment.
i know myself too well, the girl would just be angry because i would be mocking the movie the whole time.
i would not get laid if i watched that with someone.
lol dragos.
0 failures though!.
woah you had sex with at least 5 different girls???.
sty, that is none of your business.
I'm n = 1 success..
probably around there.
have you gotten laid 100% of the time you've watched it without someone too?.
n = 5?.
*what's.
what the sample size there?.
and 100% of the time I've watched the notebook with someone I've gotten laid after so woodrow has a point.
rekt.
^gay!!!!.
Girls will do anything after they watch that movie. Take a note.
Ah the Notebook. I've seen it.
her story is the most interesting and i think she is one of the most convincing actors this season.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/giphygifs/media/LOeZPgy67l160/giphy.gif.
#gif Rachel mcadams.
you are right in that rachel mcadams is by far the best character this season.
Also she hot.
I think the dialogue is pretty tough to compare between seasons because the themes are so different. The show is still incredibly dark, but the supernatural/religious element has been removed this season. All the characters are equally tortured, but display it in different ways. Rachel McAdams is OUT OF CONTROL good this season.
Something went wrong.
#gif hot international girls .
Is.
But that is the issue. True detective doesn't feel very authentic. Way too grand. Who knows though, I'm not a swamp land detective. Maybe that's how life it.
I agree, i just think you overestimate this season's dialogue.
Dialogue can be so useless or fake or just a filler but when it's done right it makes everything about the show / movie / book / play more believable and authentic..
And Woody, I'm such a sucker for good dialogue. It's what makes a good show great..
right on girl.

hey andy remember that time you got spanked at futurama.
you dumb moke.

Guy needs to chill the fuck out with those movie.
I don't like Wes Anderson .
who is he in the royal tenenbaums again? i totally dont remember.
I fucked up.
Wait.
?? Have you never seen royal tenenbaums? Man can act.
pretty sure he thought to himself "dazed and confused" was 20 years ago, time to do a new character, and then started acting.
Did mcconaughey just wake up one day and decide to just turn on the acting?.
yeah, but at least matthew mccouneghey sells it. i just cant buy Vince Vaughn trying to be deep. In the scenes where he's being a gangster he does a really good job though.
Nobody talks like that (I'm only on season 1).
Also this is a family guy reference, I'm not a douche. True detective is a little too much though. It's like listening to a book on tape when they talk.
Shallow and pedantic .
I'm out.
Time to chime in. Watches are cool. Rick and Morty is great. True detective is good but it insists upon it self, very pedantic. Everyone get back to work.
you know what isn't pure crap though? rick and morty. can't wait for them to get to the episodes that haven't been leaked yet.
Last season was like best television ever until the last 2 episodes and then it became pure crap..
although i am skeptical of that claim.
but that's yet to be decided.
ok i will watch.
I'd argue better than last season.

but watch out.
i guess you win this time.
it's cloudy today and I have to work.
alright lets test this. go outside and fall asleep: when you wake up guess the time and report back.
I'm actually really good at that.
if you're outside just learn to tell the time by looking at the sky scrub.
It's way easier to work with a waterproof 30$ watch than it is to work with a $400 smartphone that can be ruined by any element.
I used to be anti-watch but after working outside so much having a watch is so much more convenient than carrying around a phone all the time.
boo time!.
also watches in an age of smart phones.
daylight savings time is also stupid.
time zones == freedom.
dirty communist.
and China does that!.
bet the pre game show starts soon though.
do you think it would ever make sense to get rid of time zones entirely and have people just get used to doing things at unusually numbered times in different places?.
2 more hours of work fellas.
you are right, it's 12pm EST, 1pm AST.
yeah, idk. i just assumed they would start at 9am west coast time which is noon east coast and who knows what in your monopoly time.

Point of order, I'm actually great at rendering via Maya. I took two classes on it.

Tool*.
Jon I'm actually interested in learning blender. I have a friend that uses it for his work and he said its an incredibly valuable too.
thanks mike. im gonna keep learning blender stuff for now.
if you want to do cad and not rendering, i have a couple of good options, but they're certainly not artists' tools, but engineers' tools.
words..
point of order: i don't do rendering, just 2d/3d cad.
also im trying to learn 3D rendering shit, mikes far ahead of me so would anyone like to learn with me. I'm using Blender which is free software, and a bunch of tutorials from a subreddit i just started to follow.
the first post already had me going. "women talking to women about being women".

So the real marketing opportunity is an ad network that can find me local horny milfs.

maybe he has amnesia, and forgot who he is.
I wanted to wink at him when he got on but I wasn't paying enough attention, I think I kissed him.
puns salt all wounds.
you should have tossed a pun his way as you walked by.
But do you know who he is?.
That good justice feeling where he looks so foolish. Ahh it was so good. .
I made prolonged eye contact. I am so justice hard right now.
Slowly.
And he got to watch everyone board in front of him .
So they boarded him last.
He kept being like "do you know who I am" etc.
Some guy was causing a fuss about getting on the plane. Being loud and obnoxious. He paid for some boarding thing and they were telling him to wait. .
...yeah that just sounds like you blew a guy in an airport stall.
Try.
Hard to explain via text though.
Also I just fucking rocked some guy in a suit. He won't recover for weeks.

dude, popeyes? have some self respect.

Popeyes for lunch over here.

We still talking about food?.
And smoke.
And ribs and spices and sauce.
also belly rubs and beer.
isnt it just "slow and low".
I don't think someone just "figures out brisket". I feel like it took years to understand pork basics .
the only reason i like beef ribs is because i feel like fred flintstone.
Can you get it here by noonish?.
Figure out brisket and then get me some.
I think brisket. .
This conversation is making me so hungry.
With more research and effort.
talkin what, brisket?.
We should make some beef BBQ .
You got me.
yeah this scrub is using westlaw when google knows whats up.
Andy I googled like "Big Laws in 1882".  Get on my research game.
true, that was a very seat-of-the-pants beef adventure.
We gotta give beef another go. Initial tests very shaky .
Whatcha got there google? Try and get on my westlaw level. Also I guess you never heard of the Alien and Sedition acts?.
i tell you what, im not very hype on most other bbq than pork.
Slaw is great. If you don't top pork BBQ sandwiches with slaw, you fucked up.
slaw is good.
if not laws, what about slaw.
Yea we only passed the first law restricting immigration that year, but I doubt laws are an important part of your research .
Side note, ways I know my research has gone astray: when I'm looking at a supreme court case from 1882.
i mean, in a "huh didn't expect that," way, not a "yup kaleidoscopes on acid" way.

I'd rather a woman think I was puking than shitting.

apparently courtney thought i was puking in the bathroom.
i also took a pretty solid shit during wine night.
i forgot you dont like spicy things so much.
Also sinus blowing.
I agree with mike. Cooking every meal is a bit much, not to mention I enjoy cooking for others, but if she has no interest in how rewarding and thoughtful the process of cooking food is...then girl, that's a deal breaka.
its mind blowing.
mike you;ve had liz's jumbalia.

food is pretty key.

Unless you want your hat to shit on you.
A duck would make a bad hat by the way..

Andy must be referencing that you won something, LAN party for doto, and that ducks can also be used as...a hat..

The latter is cooler.
Or ducks that go to space.
So you're saying we need to design spaceships that quack..
But ducks fly and spaceships fly so I guarantee I know what I'm talking about.
I'm a duck scientist tho so don't quote me.
You obvs need a window that can release for emergency landings on water or whatever.
Jan doto now.
That seems right but I don't know enough about spaceship design to refute it..
I feel like windows that can roll down is probably a design flaw.

I'm not sure how it would work, but think bathroom graffiti, but on your phone.

Call the app "Porcelain Portal".
I wish I had an app that would shut you the hell up..
Think of how many people would love that.
us "North Americans".
You should have an app kind of like yelp that tourists can use to locate the nicest toilet in an area for travellets.
However, this is not always the case. Some Asian countries will have business with real life toilets. The ones we're used to, that flush and you don't have to squat over a hole of filth.
Buckle up this sounds like a wild ride.
I'm tired of you saying 'us' Americans. Fuck off you Canadian fuck. .
Us spoiled Americans are used to riding porcelain ponies. When Americans enter an Asian bathroom and stare in horror at the hole in the floor that is to be their toilet, people are much less than impressed.
Good start.
Poop and puke, I like where this is going..
Which is great and all, but then comes the time when the drunk girls need to pile in to the bathroom or some dude has had too much noodles/beer/parasites and needs to go to the bathroom.
So, us pampered Americans love to travel through Asia and impoverished countries pretending to do relief work/volunteering while we're in our 20-somethings, but all everyone does/goes there for is to get super drunk and party and eat noodles for cheap.
Go on, my body is ready.

possible. was concerned about it being too noisy. not difficult though.
request: have sUN send initial confirmation? or is that too messy.
nitty gritty: it only checks every 12 minutes (i think) so i guess it could be at most ~~11 minutes late on response time. it should just reject any malformatted queries but coding is hard so DUNNO. 1 second cooldown because i can't seem to learn from my mistakes.
#remindme "100 minutes" tell mike to get that booty.

there once was a canadian named matt
who drank a bunch of labatt
when he stumbled away
he slipped on the bay
and sliced up his leg through the fat.
Shining shimmering cannnnnes sauce.
Crispy, delicious and tennnder!.
I can show you the chicken!.
I want that..
We can make those dreams a reality.
I had a dream about Canes and Wayside chicken last night. .
And scrandy for anfy? Who are you.
Wait you're gonna pass over sty for stump? That just ain't right.
You're cheating on us with another groupchat?.
Look at this fancy fuck with two group.
In a different group chat I'm in people call me Mart.
Guilty of assault and mattery.
Fat matt lbatt.
or matt labatt.
its no typo but I want to call you labatt matt.
Dragons, right.
dragons*.
And dragos should just be a typo already .
And the long lost brian.
We need one for matt and dragos.
So far weve got some pretty good name typos. Anfy, Moke, Woofy, Jan, Can, Stump.
At a certain point every word is gonna get replaced by a misspelling, and our groupchat will be unrecognizable as english.
4anfy.speelcheck.

I particularly enjoyed Anfy.
Welcome.
Hello everyone.
OK I'm caught up.
Then stay golden, pony boy.
Suck it mike!.
No wait he did!.
Be funnier I guess.
I guess he didnt like my comments :(.
It's like an adventure through time.
That he is! .
Is he liking old comments?.

Everyone hunts the one person.
No its the opposite.
it's like flashlight tag honestly.
this one seems fun because one of us will be the hunter.
Me too but I'm better if I'm playing with a group.

Hi jan.
Hello everybody. .
Andy your lack of faith is comforting.
Im not worried about woofy though, he'll try and add a cd, break sun, and then mike will fix without adding cd.
naked butts are funner .
Slippery slopes sound fun.
Not sure if intentional response to woofy, or typo.
well we are all collectively butt naked on a slippery slope.
>what hell.
>anfy.
>anfy.
Haha that's what mike thinks. Rules > all FUCK YOU Anfy.
It would be hilarious is you disabled all cds.
In all things, humor > rules.
That was a clever enough usage to not merit bringing the secret police in.
Its had no cd for so long and I only just now took advantage of that fact, and it was for comedic value. Mike have a heart.
no kobe cd slip up; mike police mobilizing .
Kobe sucks at this, no number starts with 110.

Hows your remix to ignition?.
Can you do Nelly covers.
We know ~2hrs of covers.
Woody, can I bring my band to play at your wedding?.
I'm down for either but if we're doing the latter, I call white suit.
We could also do this ^.
I'll shave my head and be the krillin to your gohan Jon, plus I want to go to Woody's wedding.
Can I dress like that for your wedding woody ^.
Sun knows you won't have to but you will anyways.

so I'll just go back to that message and read with him.
and I'll learn he's behind.
Sometimes Matt will like an old message.
How about I just give you enough high fives until you forgive me. Like the Sims. .
Woody we established that groom order will be decide by the game of games: a test of strength, cunning and deception.
I expect a lot of drinking to move back up.
essentially all you guys are doing is moving yourselves down the Bridal Party power rankings.
Can't tonight. Sometime later this week though. .
Meepo*.
I'm off for the next two days, anybody want to play doto tonight, I'm gonna play keeps.
Unless its from amazon, anyone who sends me mail can eat a dick. Except for mike, who sends me cool 3D printing things. And I guess woody. .

I have seen like every kind of boot built on tusk.

Also aui has 4 kills and no deaths.
Sacrificial ppd.
14 min arcs mek on sky.
Jesus.
Also lesh.
Yeah with jak, wr and clinkz they have a lot of push.
Jak for seige though.
At least they have es and qop for highground defence.
C9 starting big momentum.
Dgaf.
At least he got 6.
Holy shit he died 5 times already.
20 min midas op.
Aa net worth 800 @ 10 min.
Yeah it looks like ee is putting in work. He rotated early out of safelane.
Ember snowballing hard.
13 kills 9 min.
Woody and sUN were right, I cannot stream this. I found a site with a bunch of live stats though so I'm watching that.
Bloody early game so many miles.
ice is nice.
Lesh kills qop solo mud.
Eg first blood double kill.
This is gonna be sweet.
C9 (lesh aa jak ember windrunner) eg (tusk qop shakira skywrath clinkz).
c9's team is blowing my mind.
Jak (!!) Ember (!!?) Shakira skywrath.
 Brood bloodseeker techies am banned.

Lesh aa / tusk qop.
BH pl naga dazzul b&nd.
K game on get ready for too many updates.
Yeah I felt peak nerdyness while writing they.
Western teams mostly ignore undy but the Chinese love/hate him.
Tusk lesh sf qop gyro storm.
Tusk still very meta.
How about now?.
Stu. You coulda been a contenda.
Homework is for nerds. .
slim.
So you're sayings there's a chance!.
I have to catch up on my class lectures and homework but perhaps if I get sick of it.
Then I maintain tusk, but also predict snowballing heroes.
The new meta is all chat pun teams.
Or has the meta shifted since then?.
Predictions: tusk as first pick/ban. Lesh picked or banned in first two rounds.
...i cant say I ever played that.
Pregame music is lousy. Reminiscent of the super Nintendo lion king game.

Attachments of type emoji rely on data from emoji PowerUps.

Clients use a placeholder character in the message text and specify a replacement charmap to substitute emoji characters

The character map is an array of arrays containing rune data ([[{pack_id,offset}],...]).

The placeholder should be a high-point/invisible UTF-8 character..
Could but idk how python deals with unicode so I'm not doing it :dino:.

Yea, my dad had Calvin holding a baseball bat in the same place. Got this after he passed away.

Btw Jon I just saw where you sketched Calvin and Hobbes on IG, This is my tattoo.
and they analyze the video footage of his rival and it turns out that he's actually running because he's leaving the ground by like 1mm between strides.

I actually just have oddly muscular legs, and usually never feel like I need to lift them. .
Never.
I am always team skip leg day .
Cam grow up.
Yesterday was leg day. I'm not sure I can get out of bed.
Who knows, if I still end up talking to this girl later then I'll let you guys know more..
snapchat pls.
I dunno how I can get a photo of her now. I should've sent a photo earlier .
Sorry *maiden with the flaxen hair*.
Jon where can I find pics of this vegan with hair on her pits, aka the girl with the flaxen hair.
although we breifly crossed into wv.
w/e.
it was southwest virginia btw.
He could have a podcast. I'd listen..
Just so I could hear about it. .
Yeah, I wish Andy had to do that every week. .
Remember when Andy drove through WV with a bunch of middle-aged women? That was funny..
you don't need to eat steak to bang your cousin.
meth*.
and method .
also strip clubs.
i thought they just had cousin banging.
does west virginia have vegan?.
The photo class is a bunch of girls and me. I have played music each day and have swooned basically all of them. .
That means she creeped you cause she was interested..
Then, ashamed, deleted her Facebook.
oooooooooh! She friended you!.
I didn't ask. She just friended me on Facebook one day. .
hippies love their IG.
she on Instagram?.
Hipsterrrrrr.
running from her past, undoubtedly.
she actually deleted her Facebook recently. Unknown reasons. .
for science, of course.
She's going to this music festival in WV this weekend so, I'll prob take her to this vegan restaurant sometime next week .
do you have a picture of her?.
Its interesting. Its definitely limiting my pursuit but it isn't breaking the deal. .
Armpit hair wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me.
no, straight and clean well kept hair. Including on her armpits. .
Does she have dreadlocks?.
Jon, this girl is definitely a huge hippie. She probably loves Phish and Jefferson Airplane.
*at.
And the end of the day its all about calories though. Keto just made it easier to keep my calorie count low.
you tell those people to fuck off .
Its really effective. I lost 20 lbs in 2 months. Some people criticize it though for helping you lose weight quickly early on and then slowing down.
I think my brother did keto for a while and he lost a ton of weight.
I like cheese more than fruit.
Similar to paleo, but switch fruit for dairy.
No fruit or carbs, lots of meat and dairy.
Its like the opposite of vegan.
Pescatarians are vegetarians but they eat fish.
andy, what was involved in the keto thing you did a few years ago?.
Where as vegitarians only dont eat things which would kill the animal.
Yeah so basically they don't like delicious things. Except hummus. .
If its the latter jon is right. No diary, eggs or any other delicious animal products.
Too lazy to Google. Not a joke. .
yeah. fuck did i walk into that..
Or are you actually asking?.
Is this the setup to a joke?.
nothing from animals.
What separates vegans from vegetarians?.
unsure. I remember she laughed hard when I made a joke about all my campmates at firefly tripping on acid though. I was like, well I guess she gets it..
Weed?.
It's all starting to fit though...armpits, likes the grateful dead, is vegan.
> Well played!.
The question is whether she will eat your meat.
armpit girl is also a vegan I learned. Don't understand vegans. .
I tend to binge an artist.

All sounds well and good until you ask the tough questions.
How long has it been back there? What state is it in?.
Dude it's chick fil a. That's not so gross.
You really need to clean your ears jon, thats gross.
Best magician ever.
"Hey what's that over there" *pulls out a spicy chicken sandwich from chik-fil-a behind their ear*.
*truck.
There arent any nearby. There's a trick that is sometimes near my school, but thats not where I am today.
And it's not even Sunday. You have the power Andy.
I want chik fil a so bad now.
So no worries. Just give me a spicy chicken sandwich from chik fil a and we'll call it a day .
Jon makes a good point, if the statements are true then you're off the hook.
But in general libel/defamation is way harder to sue for in the US then in europe.
That is the truth though. .
So if I printed something saying jon was a rapist, he wouldnt have to prove that I maliciously intended to hurt his reputation, just that I printed it without giving a fuck about the truth.
http://gamecola.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/words.jpg.
You can sue for defamation as a private individual and the standard is mere negligence, but you need to prove actual malice for public figures.
Everything..
Follow-up question: what's love got to do with it?.
Standard for defamation is different for public figures because you out yourself out there.
Interesting. What does being a public figure have to do with it?.
Could he sue? Yes. Would he win? Almost certainly not..
Probably, but since he's a public figure you would have to prove malice, which is unlikely.
If he gets raided and it comes out they were looking for child porn, but they find nothing, could he sue for damages? To his image and all.
Unless you're a cowboy cop.
True. Also you have to assume they have something pretty solid to go on if they are gonna raid the house of someone and say its for child porn. Even the implication that someone has it is super damaging so hopefully law enforcement wouldn't do it all willy nilly.
Yea I mean I guess with his past there's pretty good reasoning to check him.
So according to official statements it might just be that they are investigating him because a guy he worked with had child porn. Wonder if they find anything.

Visited two haircut places. Both had closed (permanently). Not sure I'm getting a haircut today.
Do you use honey or vinegar or something?.
Also. I haven't used shampoo in over a year and my hair has never felt better and my dandruff is gone.
I get my hair did like every 3 months. Whenever it becomes long enough to bug me.
jon im not sure that was a paraphrase, seems more like a direct quote.
pretty much. Considering how many times he lied and she tried the thing he lied about, it was pretty obvious what was gonna happen.
That story literally says that Delilah nagged him so much he just gave up.
"These hoes ain't loyal" - paraphrased .
Bros before hoes is the original commandment .
Also about not trusting bitches.
Shit there are bible stories about how long hair makes you awesome. Why disobey the old testament.
I know you Andy. I do the same. Cut for homecoming, cut for prom. Shaggy for lax, shaggy for summer ez. .
Very different lol .
We are very much opposites on this.
I get my hair cut every 2 weeks. Sometimes a week and a half. .
Usually one step above buzz cut. Not close but pretty short. The I wait 6 months and do it again.
I don't... Close haircuts... No. No. What if you want to lax? Are you going to lax with short hair? That's preposterous. .
How often would you say you get your hair cut?.
*right.
Its hard to argue with or even understand that, so you're probably rught.
Black barbershops OP. Not only do you interact with people that kind of scare you, you get the added bonus that they're also super fucking good at close cuts. .
But your hair is dead. Germs make things dead. So your hair is probably riddled with riddles.
I mean, i dont think the germs are in my hair. And i'll probably get shampooed first. But at the same time, the fact that I have to ask maybe tells me the answer. I really have to get a haircut though.
I don't know enough about how germs work to say.
Is it unethical to get a haircut when I am a little sick?.

I will confirm with liz.
That would be excellent news for the species.
You might be thinking of geese.
THe biggest a loon can get is like 3kg.
Am I thinking of the wrong bird?.
maybe 50 one pound loons.
Classic Liz can't estimate weight.
Im just paraphrasing what she said. She was in New Hampshire so they would probably be from canada.
what kind of loon weigh 50 pounds.
She was scared of being attacked by 50 pound loons. She said that they might hit her liver after attacking her "soft underbelly".
Is Liz looking to hunt loons with her bear family?.
I thought loons just weren't to be disturbed and you're ok. They were endangered / protected in Vermont so we just gave them their leeway.
And the only reason these birds congregate in cities is because dumbasses like to feed them all the stale bread they have lying around.
wuss .
http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/goose-attack-leaves-ottawa-cyclist-shaken-and-scarred-1.2686751.
Loons can be aggressive too but  it's not as common.
Cause geese can be super aggressive.
they usually congregate at bus terminals and grand central station.
Are they loons or geese Dragos?.

The -ly rule applies in general, there are exceptions. The adverb for holy would be holily. .

#sunstrike.
Idk let's ask Jon.
Can you fail the SAT? I thought you got a number.
I have coworkers who said they'd probably fail it. I would think not.
Holy means you're wrong as fuck matt.
Tom bought 2 apples type of shit I'm all over.
I think.
Calc wasnt on there.
It was basic shit, but sometimes worded tricky.
I guess I could do the math? How hard was it. I don't remember calculus much.
It doesn't come up much at work.
E.g. Matthew eloquently explained for his dimwitted friend..
E.g. Woody foolishly admitted he doesn't know what an adverb is..
They kind of answer the how/when/ to what extent/ of something that has happened.
Sneakily.
Quietly.
Quickly.
Anything ending in -ly woody.
Also I would fail the fuck out of the SATs. I don't know what an adverb is.
Jon. I leave my computer for the night and now you tf2!! NOW?!.
They use the sat in canada?.
If I took the SAT right now I'd do infinitely better than how I did in high school.
i could.
Can anyone TF2 tonight?.
only because i know the lsat is way harder for the relevant corresponding sections.
yes and it would probably be close.
Q:  do you think you could pass the SAT today, and if so, with a better score than in high school.

I guess events only let you do up/down voting, no real poll.
as it is we can just do stuff with events.
i wish groupme had a poll feature so we could get people to vote on things.
one of them is bound to work.
i say jon takes the shotgun approach and sends every suggestion in quick succession.
it always goes back to dick pics.
ooooo.
you know whats the opposite of classic asian fake tan.
A picture is worth 1000 words Jon.
"you know what they say about asian guys? No? Good. Don't ask.".
and then switch to grindr.
"are you mulon, because I'll make a man out of you".
This is a scenario that doesn't need success. We need gasps. .
More like "successful".
Try hard ^.
Maybe make some Disney references. I could see that working. .

Then send the Godzilla emoji.
i like where your head is at mike, but the delivery could use some work.
"would you like to eat some asian for lunch? no? what if this asian ate you?".
>switch a too.
The ole switch a too.
No, ask her Andys question but then turn it into a deep family tree discussion. .
"my junk is already at half mast".
and that ask if she'd like to.
wait, asians had boats named junks.
ask her if she's got any asian in her.
I don't like her stalling.

There is a difference between "can" and "should", Andy.
Anal sex isnt one of those things.
Well at least now we know.

Maybe. Maybe it's just an effect of how every conversation is so stilted in his movies that some just come out funny.
I think that's the whole point, but no one gets it.
Dude that movie is hilarious.
Tell me you guys see the odd humor in his movies as well? I was laughing so often during Budapest in theater and got dirty looks from the lady in front of me.
Budapest hotellllll.
Hint: any three of Anderson's movies.
Wait shit.
Life aquatic, royal tenenbaums, moonrise kingdom.
and make them into a trilogy or whatever.
take 2-3 movies with the same actor/actress.
wait this is my favorite game.
Hahahahahhahahahha that's the best theory I've ever heard.
after such an extraordinary event ed norton finds little meaning to life and descends into madness.
Regardless, even if I don't understand it, his style and (maybe unintentional) humor are awesome.
for real though the movie is just a prequel to Fight Club.
Love, at least as much as is possible for wes Anderson.
that def played to my experience.
I went and saw moonrise in theaters by myself.
I thought the two children are fairly mutually in live.
Binoculars. Love. Hurricane.
young, unrequited love.
Moonrise is Tite.
I live his films but I don't understand moonrise.

woody remember when we went and saw Wall-E and that bus almost tipped over? the song strawberry swing was playing from that album in the background while we drove in and also saw that shit. Perfect day..
thats awesome. It's sick when albums do that. One coldplay album reminds me specifically of junior year of high school summer a lot. I don't necessarily like the album all that much now but it has some great memories in it..
i listened to that album all summer with my brother training for soccer preseason. good times.
yeah, definitely has that vibe. If only someone could get back to that feeling he had..
not him obviously but the beat.
and jon it sounds kinda like kanye from graduation.
cant wait for the rest.
both good though.
2nd was better, you're right.
If a rapper was able to effectively use beats like this, i'd be so happy..

1st was funny.

im not sure 30 minutes is long enough, but i figure you just toss it in there and taste it at 30 minutes and do that every 5 minutes until its ready.
There it is..
hey matt why dont you go jump in the oven with some olive oil and garlic and rosemary at like 400 deg for like 30 minutes.
Jon's heart checklist: 1.) Is it a dragos gif request 2.) Is it a hot chick 3.) Did mike send the message 4.) Is matt getting roasted 5.) Is it a short and nonsensical message .

Actually I liked that mode.
good thinking me.
yes!.
we do some Man vs Machine TF2 tonight as a test.
i think i just want mario party mini games.
then once jon and i did some medic heavy shit and jon got hyped.
i dont understand TF2, i just die a lot.
But if people are in for starcraft I could do it.
agreed.
also mike you are slowly arguing for tf2.
Age of empires is so much lower skill i think.
starcraft (2) would take a significant amount of ramp-up time, which could lead into another dota situation.
More Vespene Gas!.
wrong.
Starcraft! build units, fight them. pew pew.
i think it has to be a low skill floor game.
do better?.
That was back when I used to play on a trackpad.
skill > riches, bitches.
but somehow everytime we fought you lost....
Minecraft got to the point where Andy and I had a surplus of every resource and built everything we ever imagined. We essentially beat an unbeatable game. .
or Starcraft 2.
Id rather do Starcraft.
?.
age of empires 2.
Farming simulator 15 has multiplayer.
we need like a mario-party grade steam game.
i dont understand TF2, civ takes too long.
Minecraft?.
I miss everyone. Can we do some game night soon? TF2, Civ, anything new besides Dota.
i am omniknight.
I will also come out of hibernation to play that.
I will download and struggle through a game to play that game.

"And there's Matthew English with a wonderful apology at the 60 yard line" - Canadian football casters .
12 men on the field too.
Instead of tackling the other guy do you just apologize.
You have to say sorry after ever down.
You can score a single point if you punt the ball out of the opposing teams endzone.
what are other Canadian rules.
And a larger ball.
lol.
And a 110 yard field.
Yup.
did you only ever have 3 downs?.

Lots of animals are tortured, I'm not going to get hungup on one specific example.
Wow, thats pretty terrible. I guess I can add that to foods i wont eat. .
but it's a scientific fact that the tastiness of meat is directly related to how much the animal suffered on its way to your plate.
duh and/or hello yeah of course its shitty.
It's incredibly cruel.
Wow foie gras seems mean now after a google search.
foie gras is a thing, confirmed.
Diabetic duck?.
Maybe next winter.
Is that what that is?.
Go!.
Ready....
Well, foie gras is a thing.
Alright matt, you job is to make duck beer with real duck.
And if future farmers would ever intentionally give their animals diabetes.
Ducks will definitely eat hops.
I wonder if diabetic animals taste better.
fois gras with hops?.
Matt, will ducks eat hops? .
Kevin changed the topic to: If the person is a diabetic the process of whisky to urine is reverseable.
So maybe diabetic ducks?.
best sentence 2k15.
If the person is a diabetic the process of whisky to urine is reverseable.
you sure you don't got that backwards?.
But thats probably unrelated.
You can make whisky out of urine.
but it'll blast your eardrums out.
brb, google.
Can you make beer directly from ducks? is meat beer a thing?.
matt are you allowed to drink goose island beers.

I assume you can look up matt as well because of nsa shit.
Andy can you look up which one of us pays the most taxes.
What you should actually do is look up tax protester and sovereign citizen literature. The IRS loves receiving that. Did you know that you can redeem your birth certificate for billions?.
Big brother really cares.
You should send them your feelings. I guarantee they will be taken seriously and deeply considered .
For the record, the IRS took the money, but asked me to correct the return. I feel like if you take the money I should be done with the whole thing.

Speed bump not a roadblock.
nah shes got a bf were just friends.
Ask if she wants to go biking later.
Dude, thats your in dragos.
Lucky I'm not looking at this groupme on my comp.
haha my coworker saw and she was impressed.
ok, sorry that should do it. my bad everyone..

Allow me to get that out of the window.

Thats aggressively nsfw.

if you jerk off 5 times in a day that 5th workout will prob reach 1 hr no problem; just speculating .
Even if you are looking at bike porn.
But it is pretty damn impressive..
Jerking off for 20 min doesnt count.
Just because I don't run don't mean I don't cardio baby.
Follow your dreams.
i wanna be a bitch.
and mee.
Word, i'm glad I have a goal now. That goal is to make woody and mike feel like bitches.
I'm always available to talk about your running routine if you ever need it. But it's not as daunting as it initially sounds, you'll be fine..
If the app I'm using is right, I should be able to run a 5k in 5 weeks. That seems too slow though. I may need to up the pace to 4 runs a week.
K, i'll skype you at some point and discuss details further. But i'll sign up at some point this week..
Lets do it.
But ok.
The correct answer was aim for the bushes.
I'm down; its always a great experience. It's something to keep you honest during the summer. Always very fulfilling when you're done..
You thinking what I'm thinking?.
Okay, so its narrowing down to you and me andy lol..
Well I'll be in Tennessee so no.
Heres the site so you can check it out more: http://www.navyhalf.com/.
Running sucks. Fuck running. .
Sun said i could do it so I'm in.
well it seems to be the only half thats around the time that makes sense. I think i'll sign up, Andy, Stu, Mike etc. you guys interested?.
Are you dancing to remix to ignition with your mom?.
You must be swift as the raging river.
Woody, counterpoint: be a man.
I don't want to be limping I wanna be dancing out there.
It could ruin the foot stuff him and erica have planned for the honey moon.
"If anyone has any reason why these two shouldn't be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace."

"LOOK AT HIS FUCKING FEET! THEYRE FILTHY!".
Yea I'm not going to do it. I'm no fool.
hm...i'd rather you not run. It's risking potential injury etc for wedding day woody.
Counter points:

1) As long as you don't tell people you're in pain from running in a half-marathon, people will think you did something super manly to merit being in such severe pain.

2) Who looks at feet at a wedding?.
September 26th.
I would need to check my cal, I'm in Chicago .
Thats six days before.
When is your wedding woody?.
Woody, does the date make sense time wise for you?.
2) my feet were destroyed. .
Im in.
I've pretty much done that and 1) you don't look tough you look like a bitch.
yes.
I only just started running again. Could I be ready for a half marathon by the end of September #?.
Woody, don't train for the marathon, and then run it so you look tough as fuck during your wedding.
lol don't do that ^.
If you don't train but power through the pain, multiple weeks.
If you're trAined, Jons answer.
No no.
I dunno probably a day of rest and you're alright..

Is your mom a marine Andy?.
It's still super cold in the month of March isn't it?.
My mom did that one (true story, not a self burn).
Marine corps marathon .
Andy I don't need your beltway insider math.
I'll do research and look at reviews etc. then report back. I'm just gonna be looking in the DC area since that's what makes the most sense.
<3 duckboy.
ITS MONDAY.
DC is probably ok.
oops.
oh.
I'll let you think about that logic matt.
but you have to come back after you run it, Andy.
13.1 mike. Its a half.
No further than 26.2 miles away.
If we do dc people can stay at my place.
Is DC near enough for you woody? Or is that too far?.
I could be in, but only if it is nearby. .

So not philly.
I'll look for a good one and report, but I just wanted to gauge interest..
I could be down if its nearby.
I always do the Philly Rock-n-Roll half which is October 31st this year...which means I can't dress like an idiot and drink a lot of alcohol so, maybe not that one this year.

sUN, does this magical land exist #?.
Looks like we need to consult the sUN god.
So you're agnostic about this magic land.
I'm not saying it's a lie; I'm saying I have no evidence to show it's true..
If you tell me that Donald duck in math magic land was a lie then my entire tower hill education was bullshit. Pretty sure I watched that movie like half a dozen times while I was there.
1) no, but I need coffee before I study them
2) sensationalized, yes. especially the grace at which they moved on land. but other than that, most morphological aspects were accurate.
3) as far as I know, ducks are poor mathematicians. I cannot comment on any special land they may or may not have access to.
4) never heard of it.
ok I'll answer these in order.
Do they like quackery coffee.
Furthermore, are ducks especially good at math and do they have access to a special land combing that skill with magic?.
Matt as an expert was DuckTales generally accurate or was its portrayal of ducks sensationalized for TV?.
Do the ducks need coffee before you can study them?.

He said, responding to the earlier written remark..
But reading is for nerds?.
Its an historic case. And scalia's opinion is like 5. For kennedy's opinion though, the substantive legal arguments start at section III. Everything before that is just giving the factual background of the case and the historical background of marriage law.

100 pages?.
Refer to earlier comment about your douchenozzelry.
I heard his arguments were quality there.
Ok now do the ACA decision.
It only works because people listen to it, but its not like it has a military.
No. Just that it was exceeding its powers here, and that it has no real enforcement mechanism.
Wait did scalia argue "the supreme court is bullshit"?.
Read it yourself douchenozzle.
Damnit I meant scalia on the ACA.
Im also pretty sure the states and federal government aren't about to pull an andrew jackson, so that seems like a silly thing to bring up.
Kennedy does a good job responding to the anti-democratic argument I think, and the originalism argument is simplistic imho.
Thats basically the gist.
-the court system depends on the other branches of governments and the states to carry out its orders. If we keep this shit up, they're eventually gonna tell us to fuck off.
-you cocky sons-of-bitches arent even trying to interpret law anymore.
-by having 9 unelected lawyers decide this case you are undermining american democracy.
-the question should have been "did the people who wrote the 14th amendment intend for it to legalize gay marriage? No? Ez case".
I'm not sure I can do justice to the words of a man considered to be one of the best writers in the history of the supreme court in a few blurbs, but I can summarize his arguments:.
I heard it was entertaining. Can you cliff notes the funny parts andy?.
For anyone interested in this sort of thing, scalia's dissenting opinion is entertaining. Also the final word in it is "impotence" which is pretty funny.
Fuck yeah dude. Come down to dc. The wine and cheese thing will be celebratory .
just because we can.

So suck it nerd.
But its entertaining for me.
I know putting pressure on you only makes it less likely to happen.

true story.
one time i was really horny so when i got back after a long day in the lab i started spanking the dragon tail but i fell asleep doing it cause i was too tired.
O God.
Stu changed the group's avatar.
From that fateful night.
Because if it did i am impressed.
4real.
Did that actually happen or is that something funny you wish happened?.
It honstly sounds terrivle.
My ex and I went as team rocket for Halloween one year and we banged that night and as I finished I shouted "Team Rocket is blasting off agaaaaaaain!".
And then rotate who's on top throughout.
Butt?.
And while fucking you have to start at the top and finish at the bottom.
Doing it on the stairs should be called the slinky.
Peppy Hare changed name to mikey d.
It sounded like a threesome with you Erika and a slinky .
I know but the mattress noises carries the farthest .
Stu I am not robotic! Very dynamic moves.
Heard that. 0/10.
You know who was the worst to hear fucking? Emy and goodyear. High pitched yelping and the occasional grunt.
Mostly spring noise so more robotic than anything .
Woot. Was it hot?.
10/10 better than a lullaby.
Also I've heard woody have sex.
Facebook stock is $$$ right now I am very close friends with the chief engineer of their timeline and they have big moves coming up.
Fresh pants. So nice.
I just got back to civilisation off a seabird island.
Andross changed name to Stu.

critics called it, "underwhelming".
It was called "Make Your Move".
Dont leave me hanging.
How do it end?.
Guys it ended. Don't worry I'll stop.
Wait there's an angry Irishman? I dunno his role yet.
Oh man and a rich talent scout is there!.
The club is open for one last night. Time to leave it all on the line.
Also pretty sure woody is just watching some asian version of footloose.
I feel like my heart is in the right place I'm just forgetful and disorganized.
If your making a list, the temptation to put myself first was high, but then I realized that temptation meant I deserved to be lower :(.
Also, bad ass tap boy is in jail so the Asian is dancing her heart out in an empty warehouse.
I think thats a fair assessment.
I RESENT THAT..
I'd rank it Stu, mike, Jon, me, Andy,, Matt, dragos, Brian.
Andy your estimation of trust is not wrong.
Classic.
Ah the yakuza runs the club they tap at.
She could never love a dirty tap dancer.
okay, getting more enticing.
Omg the Asian girl is a yakuza leaders daughter! .
all i have is HBO GO, and also no.
Jon doesn't. Jonnnn.
not me. i'm literally watching the groupme on my computer.
We have work woody.
Someone else put on HBO .
No. No no tap fight.
Tap fight!?!?.
I think mike. I've had to rely on him before. Also he would not say me because I locked him out of my place last time he was here.
Woah roommate fight.
It's the morning they making pancakes. Twist black roommate. Very racially diverse dance crew.
I think i'd pick...Stu.
who here would be the trustiest trust fall partner.
Feels like it was a reference to something earlier.
He caught her.
Risky trust fall happened.
This is HBO, I hope this gets naked.
It was porn the whole time.
Woah shirts off.
They did a little romantic tap robot dance, very impressive.
Romantic tapping now.
Oh no! The love interest is going back to Japan!.
nice backpack, nerd!.
not your woody though, just woody..
so we can see woody.
of yourself.
also send a picture.
i want to feel like im there.
woody please live comment this movie for us.
lol.
Hahah they just made a tap water joke. In the tap dance.
4andy.breathingheavy.
The party in Long Island had a chick I hooked up with at firefly, and two more that I wanted to see naked..
Like 2 hours. For friendship and alcohol? Thats nothing.
but I will simply consider it still. DC is still quite the drive..
Im intrigued woody.
:breathingheavier_andy:.
Was there ever an extreme tap dancing movie? I think I'm watching one.
:andnotjustbreatheheavy:.
Jon if I do, will you promise to come?.
can i have "space cowboy".
Do it.
that'd be nyce.
I prefer Admiral of Love.
You know who I should invite? The nyce girl, she lives in DC.
come down from your ivory commitment pedestal.
woody you're getting married, you're like captain commitment.
Even Mike planned ahead. Mr no plan.
Way to commit.
I will consider DC. .
If you're only gonna bang one girl forever, gotta have a few good stories or you'll get left behind.
jesus.
have i met you.
is this even the woody i know.
And we did it downstairs, no door or room. Just in the open.
Parents were home.
wow that is the most dangerous game.
You guys are moving too fast I can't keep up.
Most dangerous sex place? Erika's parents house. .
so... cool your tits jon.
im pretty sure my prof pic is me when im like 10.
They are all undergrads.
A friend of mine has his birthday on the same day, so he's bringing his gf and some of her friends.
this "mike desrosiers" is a looker.
jon you almost imposingly wise.
brb gonna creep on the chicks going on the event on facebook.
andy's last two statements are also applicable if jon had said, "i've never gotten a girl pregnant".
Because if you come it will never be true again.
Enjoy that statement jon.
don't enjoy it enough to drink enough of it to get hammered.
(if history is any guide).
I don't think i've ever gotten drunk from wine.
then eventually someone shows up with whiskey.
If that gives you some indication.
there are snacks provided, and there is no beer available.
this pleases me.
and it wasnt the guy i was aiming for either.
LOL.
Super duper .
probably the sloppiest event ever.
I punched a guy last time.
jon: too drunk.
Very.
How drunk do you think we'll get at this wine and cheese thing.
Alright, sneakiest place people have had sex?.
yes.
Does woody have stealthy sex#?.
Revealing your phobias is just the worst idea ever. I'm not kind.
You're*.
But if you have, your welcome.
Silent strike.
I don't think anyone hears me banging.
I have heard Andy banging.
Look if bros cant deal with hearing other bros doing the broest thing possible then I don't know what being a bro is.
I am not going to DC.
Liz didnt realize that mike could hear what was going on until I made a comment about hearing her with joel.
i've had enough of this.
So...good for you.
Well apparently you were doing a good job.
gross..
100% sure mike has.
How does that make you feel?.
99% sure ive heard Andy have sex.
Im touching my nipples right now jon.
Jon has the weirdest phobia thinking about me doing anything naked or sexual.
Unless he was banging you.
so that he'd stop and deal with my poop.
or also poop.
either that or puke.
I'm pretty sure if I heard andy banging someone in the same room as me, i'd consider seppuku.
You're not wrong.
And mike the easiest way to solve that problem is GO HOME WITH THAT GIRL.
Im gonna have liz bring the air matress so there will be space.
LOL.
 I do not want to hear Andy bang someone so unsure where I'll stay.
Who needs Woody when you have cheese.
hm. well. mike are you staying with andy in DC?.
Cheese will be there.
woody, is woody going.
I'm in New York, you coulda hung with me.
Wine will be there.
mike are you going.
Mike will be there.
DO IT.
yeah then theres that.
DO IT.
Accept the invitation to the wine and cheese thing.
Was thinking of going to my beach house but all my friends are at the shore this weekend.
Then I thought about going to a Nelly concert in Hersey, PA but then I thought fuck Nelly.

I was gonna drive to Long Island, NY to go to a house party but then I decided that was too far of a drive.

So dragos, when you did this, were you basing the drawing off of some other specific artist or a certain style of art, or is this just what things look like in your head?.
more like "awe tits!".

too far? too far..
andy this is why dragos is the artist and you're the autist.

But slightly more.
Well not really.

That makes way more sense.
Oh they're wings! I thought they were little mustaches.
He really only skipped the eyes.
faces are hard to draw. i appreciate the meta punting on that.
Wings for nipples? That I can't follow. Art is hard.
very edgy.
Instead of drawing a face, he wrote "FACE".
Can we talk more about the Dragos drawing?.
from the things i've learned from woody and apps, i can now determine you are a middle aged mother because you are playing phone games still.
Also speaking of mobile things, Anyone who has an iphone should play this fallout shelter game. Hella fun and addicting.
Alright I'm sold. Now if only I had some money....
>will start to figure out.
business!.
Mobile ads are incredibly ineffective so they are also very cheap (pennies for tons of views). People will start to figure out  how to deliver successful mobile ads soon, and when they do Facebook is positioned to profit, they have the data.
Not bad. Are mobile ads effective at all? Or more to the point, do mobile companies feel like those ads are effective?.
hahabusiness dot jpeg.
Mobile ads constitute 2/3 of facebooks ad revenue, higher % than Google. I think mobile ads are grossly underserved in spending, so I think their revenue is bound to go up more than expected.

you're taking advice from a Zynga guy? thats like taking moral advice from a business-savvy Lucifer.
Saying that a business is good, is different than saying that their stock is currently undervalued.
Talking to Zynga guy. Says they pay millions in advertising to put their games at the top of the store. Facebook is the only network which works, they spend almost everything there. Feels like a good endorsement.
he's not called Steel-y for a reason.

Its a place called Newark Deli and Bagel. Prob my favorite place in Newark. .
where did it come from?.
The chicken salad is good. The chicken isn't as chunky as I remember in the biderman George but still great. .
This feels more graphic than sexting.
There's also Cole slaw in here that's also great .
pepper = good crunch.
talk to me about the chicken salad.
well played.
Crispy bacon, chicken salad, toasted bread .
Woody, this sandwich is exactly like the grilled George at biderman .
The most disappointing thing is that I'm getting subway for lunch, so its not even going to be a very good sandwhich.
Man sandwiches are good. The Earl of sandwich had his shit together.

Andy waited, can't be wrong. Waited until he found a girl willing to sleep with him.
But jon think about how good it will be if you wait. Hundreds of abstinence programs cant be wrong.
Fuck that. I've already eaten half .
Wait for the lamb.
Hunger is the best sauce.
Jon wait, dont eat that sandwhich.
Can confirm that cilantro lime sauce is good on kebobs.
Getting lunch in 20.
I second the starving.
Some mint in salsa as opposed to Cilanto, feels summery.
I'm starving.
damn that sandwhich.
maybe nix the vegetables and try to make a crazy custom salsa.  Finely diced pepers, onions, cucumbers and lemon juice as a condiment.
Check out this sandwich I'm about to inhale .
http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/04/5-great-spices-for-grilled-lamb-grilling-spring-summer.html.
I think chicken or beef when I hear peppers.
pretty inoffensive.
I feel like every meat works with peppers.
I like peppers with yogurt though, so that seems like a good combo.
I dunno, never done it.
How well does lamb work with peppers.
I'm thinking on the skewer.. lamb, onions, red and green peppers. Should I make anything else to accompany it. .
Lets talk more cooking. This conference is boring.
I'll live through you Jon, you're my only hope.
I'll do these things and report in later with pictures. .
Don't stop I'm almost there.
http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/05/spicy-lamb-skewers-chinese-street-food-recipe.html.
O man or maybe Asian lamb.
I could go and go on this.
I'll stop talking now.
Drench in mint pesto, cumin, salt and hit hard on grill. Add some red pepper to pesto to make it a bit spicy so it goes with the yogurt.
I'd do like a Mint Pesto for the lamb, Yogurt sauce cause Dragos is right then cook some banging veggies on the grill too.
Ground lamb or lamb chunks?.
or maybe just add it on top.
ditch one of the sauces (peas or yogurt) and sub in some crisp vegtables (onions?).
Pea Puree? Opposed. You've got lamb (tender), Yogurt Sauce (very soft) and now pureed peas (also soft). No texture variety.
Yeah i was waiting for woody to chime in.
woah we talking food?.
I assume it involves pureeing peas. Then again I'm no chef.
Dragos what is pea pureee .
I'll pass by a good butcher later today and see if they have good lamb. .
lamb  kabobs with yogurt sauce and pea pureee.
I think I'm gonna make some Kabobs tonight on the grill. Any experts in the group have any pro moves?.

I'm taking a poop right now. Now are you entertained woody? Is this exciting enough.
It would placate me. Little lobby drama? Sounds tasty. .
Im just saying, thats a pretty good way to placate an asshole hotel guest.
I like Andy being dubious.
If its public it could be just for show. Ask the guy to rip up her time card for you.
Ask her if she can clean up one more room then gesture at your penis.
its mega awkward.
Also, some hotel employee is getting fired right next to me.

I've been cheated on too. Shit sucks. I was kinda in the same situation as cam, we were young and "in love" and I said we could work through it. We lasted just over another year before I broke up with her..

She cheated, we were young and "in love" I am a much wiser person now. Probably won't marry until I have full adult financial stability and when I get tired of slaying pussy on the beach.
Promise ring. I demand more info. Tell all Cam. Why did you break up?.
Dated a girl for 3 years, bought a promise ring. Close enough.
Can it's like you've been engaged before.
If she takes her clothes off you're in... If she opens a book, takes off her glasses, sets her alarm, asks if you took out the trash, comments on your weight, or starts snoring like she is asleep even though you know she isn't an audible sleeper... You're out.
Once you're getting married you just holler "woman get in this bed". Same idea.
Woody this isn't theory this is a truth, trust me. I love watching females walk by the tower. I count how many times they fix their hair. If they do It more than twice walking by the tower, I call them over.
Foolproof way to test in or out ness.
If she adjusts her shirt, you're out.
Theory. If you get caught looking at a girl cheat and she plays with her hair, you're in.
Jon one of your snapchats had "Tatnall lacrosse" shorts in them. Fuck that guy. .

one thing taxis dont do is pick your drunk ass up at 1 am from a shitty part of brooklyn .

Taxi's drive around randomly. Ubers are targeted trips.
led to a lot of congestion in nyc.
another thing is the number of uber cars allowed on the streets is not regulated while taxi numbers are.
Free market bitches.
Just like carriage makers probably hated ford.
cab drivers in nyc hate their guts.
Its because they're disrupting the taxi market.

the crab has to be riding the bird.
Then it would be a crab snipping a girl bikini off while New York burns.
That would be my movie poster line.
war of the worlds: tiny crab summons tinier crabs and people scratch their crotch til their head explodes.
Our weapons are built to fight man, we never expected a threat from beneath the sea....
Or is it some bullshit like war of the worlds where its a disease that wipes out the superior species?.
Are they stronger than nukes?.
Because it seems like they'd need to be pretty intense for them to defeat modern day people.
What are his powers?.
Fun.
yup.
So they just kill humans?.
the bird is the love interest ; a former mortal enemy of the crab falls in love with the tiny hero .
spoiler alert the tiny crab awakens ancient powers in himself  and uses them to destroy the bipedal demons saving the animal kingdom; .

also Mike, the logs are reporting "is it a weekday? True".
I also don't know if updates or records are working now.
I don't know why it crashed to start with.
It was trying to search through everyone's previous games before finishing booting. Heroku was shutting it down for taking >60 seconds to boot, although it was just spending time parsing games. I moved the auto update function further down in the boot order, but this is a temp fix.
No, more investigation says it wasn't.
I'm just curious what was it.

Hookers and blow is a pretty good answer to a riddle.
I'm just gonna will piles of salt to all my family and friends.
The riddle in my will is gonna be "where did all of his money go" when nobody gets shit.
Also totally gonna include a riddle in my will.
Also I feel like these kind of riddles would be better if they arent discovered until the creator of the riddle is dead or if he's unknown. The fact that there's just some guy there who knows the answer takes away from it somehow.

It was actually in my photo class. I was talking to her essentially for the first time, then she adjusted her hair real nice like when we were talking, things were on the up and up, then suddenly I noticed her armpit; part of me thinks I was staring at it for a little. Flustered I quickly went back to what I was doing. .
I wish today had been "lines from the Eminem song 'lose yourself'" day.

Maybe she's european or something.
I don't even understand. She's like super well groomed and stuff, then suddenly super hairy armpit. Its like when I found out Santa wasn't real. .

I just saw a woman with blue lipstick. It looked like she has sucked off one of these emojis.
Jon was a loser the whole time. Jon, refute me in 5 minutes if im wrong.
I feel like this groupme has dissolved to the 4 of us ever since sty moved, jon became a loser, and Brian moved.
andy i think you just got outdone on cum emoji sequences.
also can we discuss that andy did the math on the lexical distance between BBC and CBC.
Why would a jellyfish taking off his party hat be an appropriate emoji?.
more like 3_days_of_meth_face.
That one looks like a hooker at the end of her shift.
yawn_face is terrifying.
Not following woody..
That should be it^.
still campaigning to make that the official emoji of disapproval.
:boo:.

Boo Mike.

On hearthstone sometimes, but thats all i ever see of him.

What are you talking about mike? They are 676 less assuming you start with AAA and then go to AAB and so on.
easiest answer of my life.
they're one less than the BBC, they're the CBC.
I was trying to get a legit answer. I'm on the phone with them now. You can't ask "How big are you? Are you like the BBC?".
hey how big are these guys in america http://www.google.com ?.
lol that was a twist woody.
What does cbc even stand for? The cock and balls channel? .
Yea, is CBC a big channel in Canada? We don't have them here.

Mike and woody should program PMS in to sUN so that every month for a few days she's super moody and nasty.
Sun, you've been hating all day.

...wait, should most tinder matches while in key west be a groomsman competition?.
Not entirely sure how you'd accomplish it though without the group drafting for you.
A tinder competition would be pretty funny.
Your bills must be pretty cheap then.
I'd be a 10/10. These curves pay the bills.
Would make the rating system slightly less arbitrary.
Math.
What if the numbers corresponded to percentage of yes swipes if you made a tinder profile. Like a 9 would be 90% yes swipes.
ez 1.8.
I've got to be a 1.5.
Thats not saying much for the rest of us.

Literally nothing.
what can't be solved with several sorrys in canada?.
All in all a good day..
Several sorrys later, we were back to fishing.
Read about that. Crazy stuff. I was once on the border of US and Canada by Washington state fishing with my dad and uncle and two armed border guards came up to us because they were chasing three Mexicans that hopped the border and thought from afar we were them.

yeah, they'd all keep pointing at the same people, right?.
this is stupid.
no wait.
turn inner cirlce twice, outer cirlce once.
no wait a single line inside.
I was thinking a board up on the wall with all 7 faces on it in a circle. Inside the outer circle is another circle with all 7 faces which can rotate. Inside that circle is ANOTHER rotating circle with varied lines, two from each inner face to 2 random other faces.
i wish i realized that 20 minutes ago.
it requires each person to play 6 other games, and there's 4 people in each game: so (6*7)/4 is how many games. 42 is not divisible by 4 so this will not actually work.
I'm making it up in my head.
not familar.

I think a dual wheel turning doo hickey would get this done.

Woot!.
Sorry I don't have group chat during the day anymore.
I'm gonna be there!.
or maybe, very specific regional slurs.
like, ID cards and minorities.
i was thinking it'd be like, systemic oppression.
"Next week, how to stereotype different eastern European
groups".
"Asians from southern regions of china have slightly squintier eyes, and actually have a slightly higher tendency to play soccer than ping pong".
I want to enroll in stereotypes 402, real advanced stereotypes.
It was stereotype 101.

A large black just said "I'll take that for ya" as I walked by with a watermelon.

Should I try and borrow my friend drone.
Only acceptable way.
Since there's an airport .
Fly me out then .
i feel like there's an easy masturbation joke somewhere in "selfie stick".
Jons gonna get kicked out.
I'm bringing the selfie stick.
He should at least give it a shot.

And by simmer down I mean turn down.

Just bully your citizens into being happy.
No happiness no production.
25% combat bonus vs. barbarians is nice.
Honor social policy was the reason I had no happiness.
^^.
My apparently strong early game warriors got rekt.
Also a point in the honor social policy helps you fight barbarians better.
I research pottery early because blazeit.
But animal husbandry! For the lonely people.
I research archery early because archers deal well with barbarians.
My anti-barbarian build order:

Start with warrior, scout, warrior, monument, worker, warrior, settler.
I'm an outside of the box thinker.
Once i finish cleaning up woody this game will be over quickly.
#sundae.
Maybe go fuck yourself.
Mike, maybe practice starting build order stuff for next time.
I've perfected it.
Is there a way to laugh but also be sad?.
Coincidentally, a pretty close analogue to my dating life.
I still am confused by that whole scenario.
Large island waa unmaintainable. Tried to expand to get rid of barbarians. Ran out of money. Ran out of will to survive. .
RIP in peace mike.
Mike exists. I saw it.
I died.
Fooka yoo dorphin!.
Fooka yoo whale.
And I still have no confirmation that Mike exists so I can't comment on the diet of his civilization..
The Chinese do whatever it takes, dogs, cats. Well eat whatever. .
And the fucking Japanese STILL harvest 1000s of Minke whales per year for "research" purposes which is total bullshit..
But, us French people force-feed geese until they're too fat to walk, and then slaughter them for foie gras, so we're not much better..
I'm pretty sure the chinese eat cats.
Even sun knows how awesome sushi is? What does china have? Gelatinous beef cubes? Ive been, their food sucks .

Andy sucks.com? A naval powerhouse.
And you dont have guns, I saw your swordsman.
Even the name of your city is an affront to our great and beneficent leader.
I'm in a higher era. One with guns. Guns > swords. Even with your lowly science I thought you would know that.
Also this is samurai era now. The height of japans military power.
Japan is a spunky up and comer.
China's crushing Japan. .
China is old news.
But whose destiny?.
Manifest destiny?.
Should we give america back to the native americans?.
That was thousands of years ago.
Also. I settled there first. Finders keepers Andy. .
Well that village has been fucking up your units.
Japan's second largest city would still be China's smallest. I hardly recognized that village. .
War erupted when china threatened to steal land boardering japans 2nd largest city.
Nonono. The proud people of japan simply asserted their autonomy against the land grabbing chinese.
Matt is off on his own doing who knows what in second place.
Andy is a land stealing war monger living on a large continent with woody. Currently at war.

Mike battled Bavarians for 500 hers on a lone island before being knocked with a sad and poor population.

Sorry Jon sounds like fun, but I have an actual date to attend.
Firefly is tempting.
Will accept all suggestions .
Who wants to message my tinder matches tonight with me on Skype .
Also I think i'm going to go to Firefly again this year. If anyone is interested at all at being spontanous, you're welcome to stay with me and some other friends.
Yeah, the game starts out very primitive though. You start with nothing and are essentially a stupid idiot..so learning to craft a gun is much later in the game.
Jon that sounds dank.
Yea.
Still sort of a lateral maneuver.
I'd say maybe meth for heroin.
I dunno. All I know is I wanna ride a fucking T-Rex and shoot raptors with machine guns..
But it's in early access?.
Polygon reviewed it and gave good remarks.
no.
Is it better than dota #?.
I'm going to be playing that dinosaur game I was talking about earlier later. The game looks very good..
That's exactly what woody did.
Not.... Not the worst metaphor.
that's like giving up weed for heroin because weed was too addictive..
I still find it hilariously ironic that woody gave up Dota for Civ..

*hwhat.
That's a large booty I tell you what.
Stinky Face was the move name I thino.
I remember him well.
I'd say he was my favorite. .
There was a fat wrestler named Rakishi who's move was to put his huge ass on a fallen opponents face.
"EZIEST MATCH OF MY LIFE".
See, I'm already into the WWE trash talking from all the dota I've played. .

Ez throwback.
I watched it in Stu's dorm first year of college. Throwback.
It is her from that hipster British show where she was a super weird teenager who banged the main character and did Molly like 24/7.

Still not as cruel as making someone watch that goddamn commercial.
And yeah, their teamfight was dirty.
*woulda.
It would been a sick comeback had we won it.
Lol your opponents were playing blink refresher gaming.
True. Probably coulda taken the meepo who was level 25 about 10 minutes in (obvious exaggeration is obvious).
But you wouldn't have been so weak with the third.
They just ended it and there was nothing my weak shadow shaman could do.
We had just double raxed them after jon bought back, but then we hung around too long and ds got picked off and then jon got picked off, and neither had bb.
Actually i was the only one alive at the end of that one.
If only you'd had a third bracer.
The double bracer speaks for itself i think.

Yeah, but maybe she wanted to be a pole vaulter.
she could swim tho.
is that girl a mermaid.
the S.S. Cripple.
so, mermaid sea?.
On the sea of no legs.
Different rival boats.
As i am now, not the same boat as mike.
Most of my exercise involves clicking so I'd be in the same boat.
that would limit my exercise.
Will internet to see if there's anything to that.
does she have no legs?.

Also woody, a single nuke has never won a war.
That would be the correct game to play first, right woody?.
I might get fallout 3 later this summer after i get bored with civ.
I liked Skyrim actually, but you're right the storylines weren't the greatest. I don't really know what I didn't like about fallout cause I didn't play it long enough to remember since I didn't like it, a hilarious cycle..
I will simply nuke that empire, like I have done in the past.
Andy, nice Ozymandias-grade banter.
But yeah, should be fun.
I will create an empire so mighty that the gods will weep at its splendor. .
Is anyone joining Matt, Andy and me on Thursday for the war of the worlds?.
I like the idea of a really open world, unlike jon. Skyrim was fun, but honestly most of the storylines were super shallow. Red dead redemption had less breadth but much more depth and is probably the best story in any game I've ever played .
ive only read the first and i thought it pretty good.
I've been meaning to read them.
One of my best friends loooves the dune books.
damnit i still havent gotten you dune yet, woofty.
#sunburn.
Books are for nerds.
Am I right?.
If you want story, read a book.
But then again, if you want story, play Final Fantasy 7. Or chrono trigger.
Bioshocks storylines are nuts.
If you're looking for story, BioShock infinite..
It's a super cool world.
The games story is like 10/10.
I don't get you, Matt. You're an enigma. .
I don't get it.
Sounds like you had a falling out.
Wasn't a fan of the fallout series. The scale of the game and task oriented gameplays don't really interest me..
The fallout website is a 24 hour countdown. Fallout 4 rumors abound.
Is there a new one coming out? Thats a game i always wanted to try.
Fallout Hype anyone?.

What show has the restaurant that's in the dark to heighten your senses?.
no.

sun are you a pleasure bot #?.
Woah woah. I created sUN.
i can't help it if it gives me those slutty looks.
yeah that sounds sweet.
and you do keep trying to fuck it.
Monells in Nashville was like that. You also didn't order food, they brought family sized portions for the whole table.
you did create a robot.
im ok with that.
am i the kreiger of our friend group?.
but it could be so much more.
this is a restaurant.
alright mike, we're not trying to create a batman villan.
everyone wears blindfolds and voice changers.
just whenever you arrive, whatever table is available with whoever is there at the same time.
also, blind date night. you show up and get paired at a table with a random number of people.
i could fuck with that.
what if a sweet machine made you cocktails.
so we should diversify.
they have conveyor belt sushi.
are you suggesting conveyor belts?.
So did this restaurant plan get traction?.
both my work email and personal email are completely zeroed.
I didn't look with my special brand.
Oh my eyes 40+.
Also bookmark roulette.
except when i break my own rules :dealwithitdog:.

Shepards pie.
Bacon cheeseburger.

Mac and cheese all day.

Matt is sous chef at my restaurant .
when this is all over we should move to morocco and open a chain of falafel stands.
Yankee Noodle.
I cooked a badass pizza tonight. Dough from scratch. Pesto, feta cheese, nozza, and prosciutto. Tight..
Make my Mac and cheese restaurant.

By trade or practice?.
Did we ever discuss whether Matt has a sweet Canadian engineer ring.

Maybe.
Doesnt count woody and jon arent engineers.

That Mariah Carey gif was not the worst. It was nice. .
She took like 5 minutes then understood it was meant to be funny but was pretty pissy until she figured that out :sheep:.
Even if you do understand it, its still really funny. Plus philosophy is a big fucking subject, so there's always gonna be some stuff you havent encountered yet.
I sent it to my sister and she was moderately offended that I didn't think she understood the subject matter.
He makes complex subjects easy to understand in a really funny way.
All of his posts are fantastic though and I know I've posted this on here before, but if you are ever curious about any subject relating to philosophy check to see if he's posted on it.
I want going to read the post because I thought he'd answered it seriously, but then I read like the last 3 lines and got super confused. Get fucking rekt kid.
>While Utilitarianism is about a thing, the social contract is primarily about a different thing.
A post from my favorite blog, I'm dying laughing: http://www.philosophybro.com/post/104700123978/hey-bro-i-was-wondering-if-you-could-give-me-some.
Is that what did it for you?.
If anyone was curious of the nerd level of the group, we have now established that mike has a favorite unit of measurement and stu has a favorite metric prefix.
are there 10 decals on your car.
Deca- is my favorite prefix .
"Deca-tryhardons".
eh.
Also I thought of an effort unit: tryhardons.
IF YOU REQUEST A GIF NOW, YOU'LL GET A SECOND GIF FREE!!!!.
FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY.
DID WE JUST GO INTO BILLY MAYS MODE????.
"I want to be metric-y, but I don't want to use metric"--- THEN DO I HAVE A SOLUTION FOR YOU.
my favorite unit is either the kip (kilopound, 1000 pounds), or the ksi (kilo-psi, kilo pounds per square inch).
I cant think of a good effort unit.
metric, you know me bb.
Hilarity measured in kilochuckles.
= D_big.
Hilarity/effort.
69 amirite.
Ah the Desrosiers number.
You could always set it for specific typos. I cant think of any good ones though.
ive found things that you can set custom dictionaries and stuff for but the prep work to hilarity ratio is too low here.
I appreciate you considering it though .
Yeah it would have to check every word against a dictionary or something. And even then it would fuck up often because of dota terms, abbreviations and slang.
erf this would be too difficult to get to work right. it's not just about calling out one word, it's about a lot of things.
.............hang on a second.
Also in before "we".
Its too bad sun isnt slightly smarter. If we could program her to call out typos it would be hilarious.
> what hell.

Thursday night is becoming my game night. Just a single night for whatever, Xbox, or PC.
Follow your dreams.
it just has to happen, I was thinking today how much more I could get done in the fuckin 100 days that I played dota. I don't regret playing it cause the game gave me people like matt, dragos, cam and even brian. But for the at least for the time being, I need to really concentrate on what i'm doing.
i snapchatted that I was uninstalling to my sister and brother and even they were confused.
JON IM SORRY PLEASE DONT LET IT END THIS WAY.
yes.
sUN, is Jon quitting dota because in our last game, he had to solo support while I played techies #?.
That was a roller coaster of emotions .
ok im done.
sike i only play O's in tic tac toe.
sike i have a medical condition that lets me only shoot out X swimmers.

if anyone wants to see how a midas buy can throw a game watch the 4asc v. bu game 2. viper gets a midas instead of a mek when they are way ahead. 4asc has now pulled ahead with a pl, magnus and weaver.

I get culture for every enemy I kill. Gonna be swirling scotch on the corpses of english soldiers.
Lol wood. The military prowess of the Aztecs shines through..
*now.
He had one nuke and spent it. No he has to fight a land war with a navy. .
Problem for you: nukes in the air.
Problem for him is, I aint no france.
Woody isnt north korea, he's more like germany or japan but with nukes.
If history has taught us anything, its that the Aztecs live forever..
I anyways went with the north Korea strategy too, woody.
Wait no false. The sun never sets on England. It sets hard on the Aztecs .
True.
Andy's world is cooler.
The civ game has boiled down to Andy has like 3 amazing cities filled with wonder and technology and I own the world with a series of slums and military might.
;).
Caught uuuu ;).
yes.
Is woody bluffing #?.
Airbags won't save you from a massive naval fleet. .
Build a giant airbag to protect your cities.
Lob it back.
Can't you get like antiSAM artillery or something?.
Just build a really big tennis racket.
i looked that up as soon as i saw woody had completed the manhatten project.
you cant intercept nukes in this game.
Andy pls build anti aircraft structures.

with 17 bloodstones = electro:sheep:.
*strong independent disco deer.
i farmed my own aghs. im a strong independent woman who dont need no alch.
You didnt have an alch farm you an aghs though so only A- .
So basically wp!.
Unless they have no magic damage at all, bkb is necesarry on that hero.
i even built bkb. that was a game of "welp guess i gotta buy these items".
Yeah, not really bad on any hero especially since the cd change. It probably ups your farmspeed too.
Move speed and push. Fairly standard core lesh. A lot like timber.
You need the bloodstone first for sure.
The travels are weird but yeah that seems like the right order.
In that order.
 Arcanes bloodstone travels octarina Shivas iirc.
Lol, fair enough. You did play lesh.

Its basically a hearts worth of regen during a teamfight.
Lol no.
You're overthinking this: it's for the tankiness and CD reduction. The hp regen is a slight bonus. Can we move on?.
Boo.
FIGHT!!!.
FIGHT.
I'm not going to be able to convince you but I don't agree.
Not game changing but still good i think.
In teamfights it could matter.
So basically 10 hp regen per second for each hero burned.
That's math alright.
So the formula would be 50*.75*.25*number of heroes burned.
Sun you dog.
never mind.
No, you unclefucker.
guys andy's gotta get skin cancer from all this #sunburn that you're giving him.
It wasn't even that much regen on a slotted lesh.
50 DMG Andy...it's not a lot of regen.
It's 50 dmg / sec Andy.
I do like one direction .
#rekt.
How much does radiance do? 70 dmg/sec?.
You wish you could last longer.
#uv-Auv-B.
In teamfights it could make her last longer.
#skintan.
fuckin rekt.
YOURE MINIMAL.
If you have radiance burn on like 2 or three heroes in a teamfight, that isnt minimal in the midgame.
By HP gain I meant steal from resistance.
calling octarine core ocarina: still not old..
100% uptime illusions with ocarina.
Tankiness.
Mostly mana and CD, the HP gain is minimal.
Probably solves any mana issues she has too.
Decreased song cd.
Decreased illusions cd.
Gain health from radiance.
no-tail and him do octarine on naga, whats the idea there.
Makes sense. Naga is really strong right now in pubs i think.
he's been playing leshrac and naga a bunch but thats it.
Has he been spamming in particular heroes?.
just ripping through MMR.
arteezy's stream has been great recently.
exploring anal... "i told you it would fit".

#gif purple nurple.
So the real question is, would madison have okay'ed the purple nurple thing.
Thats how I justify my slaves.
You mean like slavery?.
You dont need to even ethically justify it if you're an originalist, the argument is way easier: was this considered cruel and unusual by the founders? No? Then its ok.
ethical gymnastics to justify our baser tendencies .
You've actually got a pretty good chance considering the death penalty isnt considered cruel by a majority of the court .
we just need an expert psychiatrist to declare him a masochist .
So as long as it didnt qualify as cruel its constitutional.
Cruel and unusual punishment is not allowed, but cruel or unusual punishment might be allowed.
andy is that a legal possibility? .

We're the principals office for the world.
Also, cause we are the biggest and bestest?.
They did these deals on us soil.
US crimes.
what i dont get is why they are being extradited to the us.
Also the stuff FIFA is doing is significantly more clear cut than anything Wall St. may be doing. They literally are accepting suitcases full of millions of dollars.
And the people who enforce wall street stuff are almost certainly different people.
i know it is.
And thats a pretty bullshit argument: other people are doing bad things so you shouldnt focus on these people.
You can read the indictment online, which is pretty cool. 163 pages, 41 counts.
apparently a lot of people are angry that the us is going after a mostly non american corruption scheme instead of cleaning up wall street .
soccer execs in general are such sleazeballs from club owners to  league execs .
true a lot are latino ;.
Also dragos, a lot of the people involved in the fifa thing arent white you racist.

Cities are for scrubs. Create a religion, call it "Pedophilia" and sent missionaries to convert all your enemies cities. Psychological victory when all of their citizens are pedophiles .
Its easy. Just build a bunch of cities and stab your friends in the back. Gg ezmid.

Given that woodys family used to own a tobacco plantation (right?) It wouldnt surprise me if it turned out he was related.
But there is a Richard Zantzinger who patented a multiple-row tobacco harvesting machine.
not shocking.
Apparently no one with the last name Zantzinger has published any scientific literature.
I'm not, I was just doing some lit review and wondered if I could find any science published by people in this groupme..
Matt why are you googling everyone?.
Haha no, just pointing out how uncommon his last name is.
Is that sciencey smack talk.
Dragos, this is the only paper that comes up when I searched your last name in the authors field of Web of Science.
no.
Waaaaaaaas it tho #yesorno.
yes.
Was it? #yesorno.
Like most of your statements woody, that was a lie.
FYI Paulina plays words and can wreck everyone.
I'm an open book. That's how I earn trust.
Woody giving away what letters he has to mike. Classic mistake.
Disagree.
It also is great when someone makes a really good word and then you just throw an s on the end of its.
"Hey you thought really hard about that word, didnt you?".
It also is great when someone makes a really good word and then you just throw an s on the end of it.
It sets up wombo combos.
Also if there were to be any letter that should be worth zero points in scrabble its s. .
*hands.
Woody I'm gonna have nukes while your people are still shitting in their hand.
Andy if you be bringing that trash tonight I'll be burning your sheep fields before the Renaissance .
I mean if you wanna play like that then i guess its okay.
Also Andy you're a noob.
It's free!.
K reinstalling words.
You can play dike for a lot of points.
This is what he played.
Woody, pokrass just started a game of words with friends with me.

How many people can you have in one game?.
Andy Esposito created event 'Civ V' https://s.groupme.com/m22KCY.
I think tonight works for me. Can we get an actual event to see who is in?.
No one is giving me a day to start this epic battle. Are we gonna strive for tonight?.

The question is, which civ?.
Without a doubt.
#magic8.
So civ battle is happening? .
Meh.
Oh.
Thats after, Civ 5 is still on earth.
Shit was so fun..
Did any of you guys play Sid Meyer's Alpha Centauri? It was a civ game on an alien planey.
Or is that the one after civ 5.
Civ 5 you are colonizing an alien planet.
I've only played civ 3 and 4, can't be that different though.
I selfishly Vote Civ 5 because I already have it.
Gonna start reading up on it at work.
Alright this is obviously happening.
Betraying allies is the most fun. Slowly amass an army on their border, cut trade ties over the course of a few decades. Watch them wither, then strike..
You can go to space???.
This is the space one right?.
I think the first rule in this game is no one trust woody.
Step 3) Cut the throats of your allies.
Also, if its anything like settlers, riding in on a wave of sheep is the key.
Step 2) Control Spice.
Dyes or die.
Step 1) Pick Arabic empire.
the Spice must flow.
I'm always the Spice lord.
Oil, copper, whales, cows, wheat, aluminium, uranium, rubber, salt, .
So thats a yes on cows?.
Andy there are like 50 resources.
Also fuck small maps. I want this to be an epic story of empires rising, alliances turning sour, bitter feuds. Also i assume cows or something? I've never actually played this game.
false.
Woody, you're essentially about to replace dota with a videogame that is 1000X more addicting and has games that are 5X longer..
I sunk a scary amount of hours in to Civ3.
It sounds like a more complex version of settlers so I'm in.
Meh/10.
http://i.imgur.com/QYVa6.gif.
#kobe?.
how tempting is that.
They even have small maps with a huge frozen wasteland filled with Barbarians so you can play out your own GoT.
i've been looking for an efficient way to reduce the number of friends I have, so Civ sounds fun.
Small Map.
Civ is so much fun.
Ive got time.
I dont see the problem.
then the game would take a month, easily.
It could be an event for more than one day. Like, take your turn when you get the chance, right?.
woofy civ5 game with like 4 people would take... hours.
Civ 5 runs on Mac, Andy your computer should handle fine.
thats a generic-ass baby anyways.
now im gonna age the baby.
I could be down to try. Not sure if my comp can run it though so i have to check first.
Little Ariana Venti^^^.
I'm down.
can we do a massive Civ 5 battle?.
Civ 5 is on sale, I bought it.
Use that mike.
I've wanted anything more... Today.
We should do Jon for that.
I don't know. .

"So we gonna do this?".
Can claim you had a three some with twins. Never clarify further.
*Suite. *Zack. .
Twins, amiright?.
They did have a sweet suite life.
Twist: Jon marries Zach from the sweet life of Zach and Cody.
It's like a monkeys paw wish. You don't get what you want.
But will it be a female star?.
yes.
Will jon live happily ever after with the star of a disney kids show? #yesorno.
Welp.
no.
Could he take him, sUN? #yesorno.
I googled the dad. You could take him.
*his.
What would Jon offer Ariana though? 50 burritos from Chipotle, 35 Rolling Rock beers, and one childhood photo of is?.
No you need to offer it to her father.
Offer her some sweet items. Bitches love legendary items.
That is amazing.

Weird idea. I mean how long has this been a thing..shouldn't the number of unplayed songs diminish pretty quick.
http://forgotify.com/.
Just because you fuckers are such god damn music hipster fucks.
Jon / everyone, you should check out Kurt Vile if you're looking for new music. Laid back summery hammock music.
>what hell.
>they're not my suited.
I've tried but they're not my suited.
I don't listen to Decembrists.
Ah I forgot that crane wife was them. I liked that one. Sons and Daughters is nice..
My favourite Decemberists song is probably The Crane Wife pts. 2 & 3. Tugs at the ol heart strings..
Same with the Hazards of Love..
Castaways and Cutouts is a great album too..
All of The Crane Wife. That album is beautiful.
I like that song though. .
Suggest some other decemberist songs mike other than Don't Carry It All.
Can. Listen to that playlist you followed and give me suggestions on additions.

2 cameras?.
In this scenario is the camera pointed at our dicks? Because otherwise how would we know.
First one to get a boner wins/loses.
Let's just watch porn and criticise the storyline. .
My personal recommendation would be flash gordon, but I'm open to suggestions.
With interludes to yell at jon for having bad taste in women on tinder.
Alright so thoughts. Since I'm not coming to cville, who wants to do a skype viewing of an agreed upon movie this weekend while drinking?.
> don't like to woody.
Don't like to woody. Dudes a prude. Be naked on the reg. .
but don't be naked on the reg, thats special treatment for hot ones.
You should be doing regular performance reviews to set a standard. Don't ask, just schedule .
Like what usually happens in dc.
I think the trick is to be a seductive intern and let people come to me.
*part.
Especially not the prt where an intern asks to assess someones performance.
I dont see how that could go wrong.
But also have a piece of paper regarding her performance in case things go south. .
ez.
then just show up naked.
Tell her you need to have a 1 on 1 to assess her performance.
Andy I got your back on office romance.
Also the movie Barbershop is playing in the barbershop..
G *barber*: "yeah put some A1 on that steak".
Guy getting fade: "yo G should I get a part?" *implying a shaved artistic line*.
At my barbershop. Heard a great line.
 I think this emoji is pretty representative of most sentiments.
Hereby the correct emoji symbol for life.
Is there an appropriate hand emoji to covey the gesture that goes along with that quote?.
>life, uh, finds a way.
Yeah, but life finds a way.
Gravity always wins.
The movie or the fundamental force?.
i actually had a heated argument with a coworker this morning about gravity so maybe im not the best to consult on relationship advice.
chat her up on AIM.
I'm actually laughing out loud.
scottys on fire.
have you tried staring at her.
I know that as an engineer this is out of your relm of expertise but try anyway.
Mike how should one approach attractive coworkers?.
Mike pls provide more professional advice..
alternatively "is the space pope reptilian?".
Nailed it.
"does the pope shit in the woods".
Wish there was some way to professionally answer that question as affirmatively as it deserves.

Jokes on you sUN, thats still an answer.
>what hell.
>Jon friend.
also.
oof the double smackdown.
No, you boner.
Is he still Jon friend? #yesorno.
i'm still jon's friend though, so i got that going for me.
Cause I know I was..
Here's a question: who isn't an awkward blob of puberty in their teenage years?.
No disagreements.
I'm sorry for my friend mike, andy..
Yeah mike. What the heck..
I would rather die than have to watch a video of the awkward parts of my teenage years.
hey. that's not nice mike..
much like your teenage years #gotem.
Yeah, but that storyline is often uncomfortable to watch.
The actor who plays theon is so dang good. I'd argue the best in the series.
yes.
sUN did i bring a nerf gun to graduation in efforts to win a nerf war #yesorno.
And yes, hunting humans.
Then the joke was lost on yoy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs7xO5P3Az4.
Did you guys watch the video it was from?.
no,i dont.
Do you even game of thrones mike?.
hunting humans?.

In that Reek Ramsay gif, that one fucked up chick that loves Ramsay looks nice..

Its funny because I was actually considering driving two hours to cville just to put a fuck you note on mikes fridge and then leaving.
woody im reverting the shit out of that change, no emojis.

I missed the pun thread too. Hearts all around.
Form of ":sheep:".
Groupme, assemble!.
the best part is that woofy gchatted me to let me know there was a pun thread going down.
I was also proud of the one that spanned over 2 messages. Your collapse one may have been my favorite though.
"die if i backed out" was underrated excellence, andy. 10/10.
can't beelieve I missed the pun thread.
https://i.imgur.com/zooifcx.gifv.
ok no emojis ever in sUN. fuck you andy you're not my real dad.
We should have it. You should make it. Dance for me monkeys.
most useless groupme message 2k15.
>^.
^.
"we".
And if mike is right and its easy to include emojis, then we should have a random emoji feature.
*woofy.
My bad.
>what hell.
>woodt.
I saw that coming from a mile away woodt.
3) i retract 1.
2) sUN could include emojis in her responses super easily.
Check mate.
Perfect. Come to Cville this weekend.
1) buy me beer and we can discuss.
Guys I really believe in you, and I'm willing to do anything short of actually learning the programming skills this task needs, to help.
Maybe easy, maybe hard, maybe go fuck yourself.
Separate but related question, how hard would it be to get sun to include the groupme emoji's in her regular responses .
How hard would it be to implement custom emoji's for sun to post assuming we already had the image files?.
"fuck it this seems fun".
i feel like whoever picks which emojis to make picks them along the same critereon that woody and i use to add features to sUN.
:bee:.
unless thats like :gaycouple:.
maybe they're just friends woody.
im going to adopt :sheep: as my lord and savior.
I actually googled "are bees bugs" before I sent that. .
I still think its the bees knees but I guess everyone has their own opinion.
jury still out on season4 arrested.
"My bees are dropping like flies but I need them to fly like bees".
JON YOU FUCKER YOU RUINED EVERYTHING.
>http://insects.about.com/b/2009/09/01/bug-or-insect.htm.
Jon you truly are the queen of this groupme.
It bugs me that I couldn't come up with one.
Would a carpenter be able to keep up a damaged table? I think i could go all day.
haha ez emojis.
:sheep:.
Bee.
or will you collapse.
afri-can you keep this up andy.
Because i know jon, and he's usually on point.
I'm sure that whenever jon chimes in, the jokes will be killer.
Jon quit typing and give us some puns. I know you've got some nectar.
I'm just bumbling along in this thread.
Well i'd die if i backed out now.
Andy your words sting.
Oh honey, do you not get it?.
you'd have to comb up with better puns at least.
I agree, what does the hive-mind think?.
this is outside my ab-domain of expertise.
Maybe we should try pollen the groupme to see what everyone thinks?.
Yea I just don't get the buzz.
I assume you would need to bee in the loop to get it.
To Pimp a Butterfly Review: I don't get it, C-.

Io has a taunt, you just relocate to their fountain with a ghost scepter.
There was a hilarious situation where matt force staffed me into the team because he didn't know what direction IO was facing.
that's being added to the game plan.
I wish io had a taunt.
we didnt use your pudge taunt enough.

I like hard carry brood. I think if you do the 20 min single lane crush you can farm really fast and go carry items.
I remember one game Fidel went full HC brood after he rekt a trilane. Got a rapier and necro3 and orchid at like 35 mins.
maybe mek BM?.
congrats, you have one hero who will spend the next 45 minutes chipping at one tower.
Take over jungle, slow siege t3.
how to beat brood:
1) buy minute 0 wards.
its not that difficult to beat a trilane as brood, but the problem is, "what the fuck do i do now".
Fidel plays a solid brood.
I honestly find brood pretty easy to deal with if you have a semi coordinated team. Then again, I've never really played against a great brood.
a light breeze can keep BM from going highgruond.
Because hook is OP.
kotl can keep her from going highground, but thats about it.
 Who's the strongest hero now? Why is it pudge.
Yea. Makes sense.
can juke illuminate then he's dead.
Is KOTL too squishy? The wave clear isn't enough?.
i dont much care for her.
ds and axe both can stand up and wreck her in offlane.
a bunch of teams have been running her in the offlane, and people have been picking ds to contest her 1v1.
good but countered by dark seer.
Besides #1 in all of our hearts.

I know nothing about healthcare. I think they knew.
I just made it all up.
So I just had to talk in front of 80 people for 40 minutes about "Mobile Healthcare".

so this might be the best 6 minutes of dota-related content ever made.

Not a rapist, and i didnt get to see him. I did meet a possible arsonist, but we're pretty sure he didnt do it.
you visited a rapist?.

That's why Jon plays venge, then he can both tp to you and die for you.

Well someone explain that to Jon. He thinks it's bc I'm out of position or get 5 sec arrowed at tune.
Also if there are wards but nobody tps to save you.

When law school is over, thats going to go from funny to depressing.
sUN is offering you career advice; you can do better.
Im at my job bitch.
Get a job.
Sun should i report mike and abbandon every one of those games? #yesorno.
goddamn CD.
sun should i instalock techies for the next 6 games #yesorno.
Who would want to play a 2 hour game of dota?.
Techies sucks all the fun out of the game for the other players.
this is like andy's nam: http://imgur.com/a/tRiFH.
as a reminder to everyone, you can just go to the group chat's photo gallery to see all of this beauty.
the whole periodic table of elements pinned to the corkboard makes the whole thing much classier.
ez.
ez bench warm.
just my baller-ass state champs ring.
but there are no fun pictures of that.
the part you're missing is that i was also on lacrosse team.
matt show us your childhood.
Mike I feel like we made similar mistakes.
6spooky9me.
these photos are all formatted for your phone wallpapers btw.
Did they tell you they could help you become a model if you did some tasteful nudes?.
welp one of my coworkers just called me out for chuckling at my laptop.
and made lots of mistakes helping them with their projects.
I had a couple of friends in photography class.
Stu is looking so hot right now.
water is the essence of wetness.
i was 17? close enough.
Yeah we're all on a watchlist now.
whatever, nice dick, stu..
wait you probably weren't 18 so thats pretty pedo.
nice package.
yup, I was one of them.
source: knew many of them.
swim team kids were weird as fuck.
but I wasn't a kid.
one time I went to mcdonalds in my speedo.
Driving since 630.
by so many do you mean 4?.
2 hours to go.
My friends car smelled like mustard for the rest of the summer.
andy how's your car ride going?.
This was done at one of the biggest tourist attractions in St John's, Newfoundland, which is the capital city of the province. So many people witnessed it. We were so hungover..
There can only be one hotdog!.
Matt you had a mustard fight in the highlands or something.
Matt "bukake" english.
no.
sUN is it opposite day? #yesorno.
Because you're lion!.
the explanation is that my friend had a photography class project.
no.
is matt's picture just color-shifted ejaculate? #yesorno.
I dont believe you stu.
Mike I was never a lobster but I was a lion.
my friends and i had a mustard fight once..
Stu there couldnt be an explanation for these pics.
The village people want their sexuality back.
Goddamnit mike beat me.
Speak for yourself.
im already hard.
I'm starting soft.
My worst pic is the groupme avatar but this is amazing.
also "things on my end are about to get pretty gay" thats what he said.
DO IT.
disclaimer.
things on my end are about to get pretty gay.
i used to have sex appeal.
give me a sec.
so, Mike, did you go to theatre school or something?.
"Can I get weird with you?" Confirmed best pick up line NA.
i am fucking dying over here.
candlestick weird?.
sty pls.
because this is awesome.
can I get weird with you.
Mike.
oh god do i go full retard.
THESE ARE SO GREAT..
omg.
lobster.
latin academy.
for some reason im feeling like getting real weird so i aint done yet.
Immediately sent to liz.
wait are we having an epic facebook photo contest?.
god I love where this took us..
the time i was the grinch.
andy, thats style points for days.
Zero effort on my part.
Caleigh baked a cake for me to ask my prom date with.
LOL.
um awkward i think the girl unfriended me so i can no longer get to the prom photos.
and people say romance is dead.
Mike: So suave.
One time I just kidnapped a girl, tied her up and threw her in the back of my trunk. After driving in circles for about 30 min I pulled her into an abandoned warehouse and pulled out a gun. Instead of killing her though it just popped out a little flag that said "Prom?"..
you call girls pews?.
is that John Stamos?.
THAT ARM IS ON A PEW.
She looks terrified.
holy shit, whos that suave looking mother fucker?.
hover arm!.
the time i didnt shave.
Hang on these are on Facebook, let's get weird.
I once wrote an elaborate thing on the street in chalk.
Matt's an annoying asian girl.
Matt's*.
Anyong?.
You're an annoying asian girl.
*snaps*.
*annoying.
*girl.
That's all you have to know.
I'm a delightful asian boy.
jon, story time.
You should ask jon about his prom asking. He did some elaborate shit.
Jon do you have a newsletter I can subscribe to.
On our backs lets have "Prom?" also painted, so we could go to a local high school and cause some high school drama for one unsuspecting boy.
I'd like to be the "!" at the end.
Maybe just no shirts, and we each paint our chest a single letter to spell out guilty. Then instead of reading out verdict aloud we just tear off our shirts and spell GUILTY.
If woody wore that shirt, I'd just have a "what he said".
nvm..
woody had my idea.
That means I'd wear a shirt that says, "This mother fucker is guilty".
No to the former, no to the latter.
Cause I'm making "He's guilty" t shirts.
Better yet, is there a jury dress code?.
Can lawyers wear costumes?.
*ez.
Ex.
Just wear a mask.
Just have it be opposite day.
What if a serial killer only targets lawyers who defend him. Who would defend him? #deepthoughts.
ChuaN pls.
Ig maid cosplay.
*habeus.
Its called hanbeus butterface.
The right to paperbag in a court room has been recognized since 15th century england.
I'm asking for a friend....
Andy can you defend someone  if they are really ugly.
Ez consent defense.
Andy likes rapists. .
all I know about law I learned from Phoenix Wright.
Plus most cases settle so usually it just involves getting a better deal for your client.
You cant ask a question you know someone is going answer with a lie. But other than that, yeah you should represent to the best of your ability.
What's the deal if a lawyer blatently knows a dude is guilty and they've done a horrible thing. They have to represent them and get them off clean anyway?.
Jon would do great as a sexual assault speaker.
Silence means yes. .
Cold cold silence.

"Step right up and have your pic taken with my balls".
Set up a photo booth beneath t.
Ask for a blanket because you're chilly.
Woody im not going to half ass a ball pic. My ball pics require just the right lighting, apatute, framing, camera reference 23 not found, and contrast.
Be more ninja about your ball pics.
Newbee just drafted Tusk and Clock. Kevin pls advise.
If i wasnt in here with people i work with that would have been a pic of my balls.
Dahaha.
Dohohohooh.
Dohohohohoho.
He can just use all the cumulative hot air he's got from law school.
I fart for keeps.
We now know why woofy's farts are so bad.
Go.
one which effects the resalre value of the car.
Andy just start gulping down air. Subtly at first but then start gulping loudly. Finally cumulate in a massive fart. One which established dominance for the rest of the day.
*southwest virginia.
*snaps*.
Then i'd be Sandy.
I wish I could push your face directly into sand right now andy.
Nope, this is obviously Andy's time. Have fun!.
I wish i had brians real life number so i could call him. Also currently driving down to west virginia with two 40 year old women talking to their kids. Entertain me groupme. This is your time.
Easiest if brian messages of my life..

If Brian messages in the next 5 mins, i'll record myself eating 40 fish_sticks.
>Well played!.

Weak joke. I still haven't had my morning coffee so I'm not 100% operational..

And I guess a pair of balls that look like an upsidedown heart.
my like is sarcastic there andy..
We should just use an emoji everyone can like to show hate .

the mindgames, they'll never even know if they're safe.
support mappo watch the fuck out.
That's probably what I'll do.
why even skill ult.
matt. you should run a single meepo. just never let the other meepos leave the base..
lol. ez dagon shadowblade chen.
penitence + dagon ez kills.
i bet you one american dollar we could win with that team.
Brian.
#who has to play Chen?.
AKA: Team We're Gonna Lose.
team "first ban earthshaker".
OK we'll do team meecro. lone druid, chen, meepo, enchantress, beastmaster.
the age of meepo is upon us.
:SALTY: ???????.
MATT..
omg..

If #kobe rolls another 3, matt has to play meepo his next three games in a row.
jon is saltier than the back of matt's mom's throat.
saltier than the dead sea.
Jon is saltier than the mop bucket water at the Mortons salt factory .
g fucking g.
FUCK.

"I am ugly" - matt every day of his life.
"I can run so fucking fast right now"
-mike in every bs game ever.
i stopped building euls, didn't i?.
that is the main thing mike struggles with.
75% of the difficulty of playing new bloodseeker is containing your glee when you're running around at 1000 move speed.
carry is fun, jon. new bloodseeker <3.
and during that time we strategically build up the gold advantage on the opposing team, so that when mid-game rolls around we can sit in base and press r and win.
I don't think carry in general is fun..
but that's only for the first 19 mins.
issue with glowballs is, i think, that AFK farming spectre is the least fun part of the gang.
shut up matt. for the love of all christ,shut up..
glowballs is so dang fun. it's been a while since we've had an old-fashioned glowballs stomp.

new meta..
https://youtu.be/x6qEK-r8n1c.
example of aghs + refresher + octarine np:.
new glowballs lineup: gyro aghs, silencer aghs, farming alch aghs factory, clockwerk (for i belieeeeeeeeeeve shots), io for alch relocates at 85 mins.
also heart.
and gaming the comeback mechanics.
and disrespect.
75% of the success of glowballs is confidence in the success of glowballs.
in glowballs? treads aghs refresher octarine ez.
honestly now I would probably go treads -> blink -> aghs -> necro books.
in glow balls NP really doesnt need that much farm.
NP can offlane.
hrm bloodseeker maybe not. i love to move him into the jungle because he farms so fast, and if we have a NP, that would be a lot of resource contention.
in this meta especially.
and yes I agree.
that's the key.
they used invoker instead of spec.
also i think bloodseeker offlane is legit for glowballs. get a couple of levels, get level 6, ez ganks.
stole the idea, but lost. how do you even lose with glowballs?.
0-29.
holy fuck that poor jakiro.
THEY STOLE OUR IDEA.

i have thought it would be interesting to try and cast doto.
call me whatever you want bb.
so can I call you Kevin?.
my use of shitty was a term of endearment.
1) no pun is shitty. 2) everyone here uses their real name, 3) sUN bot is already a key member of this community.
And have nicknames.
Answer listener mail and questions .
And even have sUN bot be a character.
And then transition topics with our shitty puns.
Discuss heroes and shit.
We could get hyped about pro games.
Exactly.
dota podcast could just be a transcript of this conversation.

I think the craziest one was when Stu and I defended our base for like 40 mins and came back to win. Stu was Necro and had nothing but like brown boots and a staff of wizardry when we started the defense. Ended with aghs dagon 5.
I have had a surprising amount of those games. I remember one where Cam went Storm mid and got fucking REKT the whole while. We lost all outer towers and were down like a million GPM XPM and then Cam got a 35 minute orchid and allchatted "lol gg" and then we came back and won.
that spec game went from "we fucking lost" to "ez gaem" so quickly.
what, you're tired of super bullshit one-hit KO's jon?.
I remember that 40 min radiance game. EZ insta-ultrakill and then we won.
Traded out the assassin for a lance..
Expect even more Phantom Lancer from me in the future..

Sty be careful with these challenges. I'm 1v1 un defeated.
Andy that glow balls last night was A+.
Spectre-tated.
Hilarious game .
I spectated that .
Ez farm.
One time Matt literally got a 40 minute radiance on spec then we won ez.
Until then just buy mangos as needed.
Any timing before 40 minutes is pretty good.
You go aghs .
For support weaver i'd go radiance.
Woody 1v1 me weaver.
Best build 2k15.
Love it Stu.
 Brown boots -> Dagon-> ocarina core.
Or maybe a lotus orb?.
Not for the illusions, for the dispel.
I think Dagon is the best support item for weaver.
Weaver illusions are butt.
Euls for supports, manta for carries.
Which is an item i should try more on that hero when they have silences.
Diffusal win rate is lower than Aghs....
That would make me mad.
I think as weaver you just go diffusal.
Who jumps who? Who knows?.
I like the drow weaver matchup. A game of cat and bug.
Yea.
Yeah stu if they like counterpick or something.
its textbook.
The only way I see it working is fooling the team into thinking weaver is core .
yea, scuttle in, minus armor, minus armor, scuttle again, ez kill, ez aghs, ez MMR.
Just go with the minus armor thing.
The build would be medalion into aghs i guess.
#leshrekt.
#rekt.
So how would that be different for woody.
Do it, and feel how useless you are.
AIRSTRIKE INCOMING.
I'm playing support weaver next game.
Cent aghs + Luna aghs.
Yes.
Can you shadow amulet creeps?.
Abbadon and cent with aghs would be an awesome combo.
But until he gets aghs weaver is a lane creep.
So dirty.
It would be kinda dirty on a legit support hero.
Use his ult on others!.
But srsly if abbadon had that aghs upgrade tho.
Easiest lawyer of my lyfe.
Get fucking rekt woody.
Yea exactly.
Now Recipe for Veil is OP on Weaver. 100% win rate.
Abysal rubik probably has a great winrate too, doesnt mean its good.
I think the win rate is high because you'd only build it if you're already stomping.
Is it like a better venge swap kind of? I don't see a practical use for it, given the hero it's on, but imagine is abby had that kove.
get Lawyered.
Aghs Weaver is 67% win rate....
Aghs weaver is garbage until someone proves otherwise.

I still want to run an abbadon ultra slow.
Yes, everytime the other team picks mirana in instalock abbadon.

They did not take full advantage of their combo though.
he'll rocket from the mist.

Lineup falls off as soon as the other team starts 5 manning though. I think their strat should just be to group and push the mid towers down before alliance rat gets too strong.
what a terrible terrible thing.

CD is my fave game mode.
Any mode with Stu is the most fun.

solo ranked is concurrently the most and least fun game mode.
Bristle is actually a great low MMR stomper.
But until then fuck ranked.
Im just gonna learn to play ta at some point and solo win pub games.
Thats what my teammates spam when picking.
andy just start playing zeus, EZ mmr.
Literally unkillable.
Apparently every ranked game at my mmr needs tank.
Octarine adds like 450 HP.
Because who the fuck needs tank or mobility.
Ocarina Tinker ez CD.
Brown boots ocarina best bb build.
yes.
Would it reduce cd on things like bash?.
BB ocarina is stupid good.
Viper ocarina ez.
You should definitely rush ocarina on every hero who casts spells.
Also remember our game yesterday where woody was getting smoked mid by an invoker but then we came back and won? Good times.
Yeah 1.5 second ult cd.
With aghs and ocarina you could spam for days.
Ive seen a bunch of pros like sumail building it on him in pubs and it seems like the cd reduction on all his spells could be sweet.

they're actually going dual mid. this looks like dota 1..
Yeah that makes sense.

fuckin smoked him.
Who do they have mid?.
YOURE A THING.
Safelane centaur is a thing.
That would be a clever thing to do. After you get aghs on druid, you share unit control and a support jungles with your hero while your bear split pushes.
da eff.
TongFu gets a centaur carry..
#clevergirl.
Stu i could just turn on shared unit control and she could pick a hero to afk in base as.

Just let time expire.
All random our team.
ban no heroes. let the time expire. maximum disrespect.
And just say that they trigger us.
Can we just always ban the same 5 heroes?.
Dragons lifestealer first pick first ban.
I think the most important things to remember is be disrespectful to the other team, be supportive of each other and blame dragos if we lose.
I'm always hard for cowboy butts.

Dragos Knight just got 219 XPM with Morphling, a new low!

final build was like manta, diffusal, travels, skadi.
he did go early travels, but i didnt catch the beginning of the game so i dont know the exact order.
he also gets a bottle from time to time as well.
thats what i've been doing now.
gotcha. did he go yasha into travels like he usually does?.
he played well, but the way the draft worked, he was the only core who scaled for them, whereas hr had storm, gyro and huskar. they were behind and didnt have the late game so they just lost eventually after defending highground for awhile.
How'd he end up doing? He plays that hero a decent bit on stream. .

Captains draft is the best mode in dota IMO.
idk, you picked the qop we wanted to pick, so that was a small victory.
Yeah it was fun. I'm a bad captain. But was fun.
i enjoyed our 4v4 captain's draft game.
We should do more 1v1s w casters haha. Or 2v2 tourny.
I'd tune in just for the commentary.
Although if there was a professional scene of cereal dropping, I'd watch a few games. .

And i love that fucking video.
by saying "you wont" theres a 200% increased chance that I do.

you wont watch this but you should.
and a venge.
Team back and forth.
and, i dont know, a disruptor?.
then an earth spirit.
ez..
mike. we should do a tiny toss the tusk in. then the tusk walrus kick's the enemy back at our team..
can't wait for TF2 later. Everyone pls download if you don't have it already so we can all play.
Yeah but we had a hell of a time..
Yeah then you lost.
that shit was so funny.
were you in that game where the guy was successfully kicking away the sandking when he'd epicenter?.
* some exceptions may apply.
it's hilarious but... practically fucking useless.
when they patch it such that you can kick allies, i will play tusky again.
I'll get the whole team killed before I bail on a unsuccessful smoke. Someones gonna die.
Mike you should start playing tusk again. That Walrus kick is way too hilarious for us not to use disrespectuflly..
haha reminds me of the bloodlust we always get when we smoke. SOMEONE'S GONNA FUCKIN DIE.
Nope. Cause I'm too tunnel visioned and busy internally saying "shhhhhhh shhhhhhh".
Yea. Did you know if you use voice commands it will show as the team member you are disguised as?.
^ I always thought that was neat..
"The idea for the Spy originally came from a Quake glitch, which caused players of the enemy team to appear as allies.".
Spys that use that shit murder waves..
yea, its super good.
I'll be on like 6, but can only play for like an hour.
You should try and get good at using the deadringer with spy.
I'll show you tonight.
the surprise sky attack as soldier wins like 99% of the time. Just crouch then jump.
That shit was too high skill for me. Demo and soldier jumping is too difficult.
i like soldier but im trash tier at tf2.
Soldier is super fun once you start rocket jumping around.
Dragos would play strictly Medic.
I can see matt playing a demoman or soldier..
Theres nothing more dominant than a heavy pyro uber. Simply changes the game..
Scouts are basically invincible against Demoman, Spies and Snipers which is like 50% of pubs.
Who's the enigma? I'll be that giy.
Spy, Scout, Pyro are the Earth Spirits.
essentially the right clickers of TF2.
Medic, Heavy, Sniper.
da bomb.com.
Stu is a bomb engineer..
and Sniper.
Bad at Engineer.
Spy, Scout, Pyro.
also pyro, you're a bomb pyro as well..
cause that class is too fucking difficult..
I'd say you're our best spy player.
You forgot "don't", you dolt.
what's your best class wood.
Bad on the hallway maps though were its all demo, heavy, med and soldier.
they think it be like it is, but it do..
I can rock some faces with scout.
You are what you is.
I've never seen an impactful scout player before. probably cause the skill level is too high and all I play with is nubs.
bout to throw down some big plays.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jamuLPfQibU.
Get syched for some TF2.
Everyone go ahead and like andy's last message..
Alternatively, this is my groupme this is my gun, this is for dota, this is for puns.
This is my groupme. There are many like it, but this one is mine..
this is my groupme today. Me. My own. My words. NOT YOURS..
Woody and Stu, lets play TF2 tonight. PLS..
And I wish everyone would play TF2. If I was to put my role on a team that I play best for TF2, definitely Heavy or Medic. I'm an ass pyro and an even more ass spy..
I think i'd like that more.
like the force staff.
side note: can you change the blink dagger's double tap to blink you forward rather than toward your fountain.
kidding, woody probably does have those pics! HA! got'em.
thats no way to speak to a man about his fiancee mike.
what?.
woody i thought you already had pictures of erika.

the jugg on wagas team sucked.

If Dota is a 8/10 on the competitive scale, TF2 is like a 1/10.
Also, I have never played TF2. Report me pks.
Dibs on Masta Killah.

I'll be Scout.
<<< soldier or heavy.
it ain't nuthing to shuck wit.
Perfect.
our team name will be Wu Tang Clam.
Engy is situational pick, always need a medic through.
or engy.
I'll medic.
Maybe an engineer.
they've been adding player rating and stuff.
so pick a class, we will need Medic, Demo, Soldier, at least 1 scout, prob a heavy.
yea jawesome.
It will probably be 6 on 6 Highlander format.
Yep! Jon told me about it.
they are adding it aren't they?.
If TF2 adds competitive match making, we are making a 6 person team FYI.

Also I had a dream I was in a fuel station in northern Russia and I went for a walk by myself and stumbled across this punk band playing in a barn fronted by a cute girl who was signing in Russian and then I left because I was afraid of polar bears.
And Kevin its Barcadia, not Bacardia.
And apparently you dream about dudes.
I don't dream very big.
Also that's a boring as fuck dream.

jon needs atleast SPF 100 to protect himself from Andy's burns.
 Flawless execution.

WHAT HAVE I FALLEN FOR!!!.
#sunburn.
NOOOOO.
whaaat! andy! nice!.
Sike!.
I always thought jon was the coolest.
I always thought that mirror shield was always the coolest..
what were we talking about again.
but the quest to get it is so elaborate, i've often passed over it.
and if you can get the biggoron's sword, you can really get some work done.
ehhhhhhh you need the master sword to really get any work done, even though the ocarina gets all the hype.
you have to be aware of who has an ocarina of time on the opposing team, and then lose.
its not too weird. same shit can still work. you have to be aware of lotus orb, and not cast stuff.
I've played like 3 games of 6,84 and it's still the same game. But now it's adopted a more southern climate with mangoes and a desert terrain.
I don't know what to expect when I play dota next. Too many things have changed. Gonna feel like that old guy in Shawshank Redemption..
I did not, but i saw a sign about when i got food there recently.

Did you read the chipotle GMO stuff a few days ago andy.
Objection! Leading the witness.
that's a leading Kobe question :(.

nope..

Not as stupid as baseball, but stupid none the less..
I dunno if you like that shit, but its a stupid sport..
By the way, hockey fucking sucks as a sport Matt..
obviously.
while drinking some molson and schooners.
then you went and played hockey.
who knew an igloo could catch fire?.
we had one once and everyone just said sorry and poured syrup on it until it went away.
they have fires in canada?.
My uncle's a fire chief, so yes..
Ill get the tomato juice for the bloody rain. Does anyone have access to a firetruck?.
now*.
I'm not racking my brain for random shit that annoys woody.
You can buy crickets by the 1000 online, so let's just chip in, get 10 000 crickets, release them into Woody's house, and convince him that he's about to endure the Seven Plagues.
My favorite non-main character is Gail the Snail.
http://i.imgur.com/Xej4zUO.gif.
Would you play nightcrawlers?.
lets sneak into woody's house and live in a closet somewhere and let raccoons into his house and his garbage.
I'd like to think that we would live off of discounted cat food.
I like mike's scenario because that means we live together in a trash hole.
See the Burn $20 comment.
All income is disposable technically.
"a disposable income" is very different than "disposable income".
Although that requires me to get a job first so dont hold me to that second one.
Andy you're still in School, you're like 10 steps back.
Also a disposable income.
Fun fact i'm going to have free time when you have children.
i'm going to move in with jon and establish a homeowners association and compel woody to paint his house some silly color he doesnt want to paint it.
I'll also move next to you and be that weird neighbour who's always naked.
slowly reduce the land value of your property.
I'm going to move next to you and completely trash my house.
and also teach your dog to be a little racist so you feel uncomfortable taking it on walks.
Stop trying to invade my suburbia life.
im going to sneak into your house every night and play with your dog and teach it to love me and not you.
I'm not going to be sad when I have your children's love.
Also a fun fact: You can MAKE BREAD FROM BONES.
fuck you i can kidnap a child today.
Fun Fact: I'll have kids when you're still alone and sad.
Exactly, mike..
i bet jon would even teach her that snow white is a poor role model for young women, and that she should strive to find happiness not through a man, but though her own self esteem, and woody wouldn't even think to teach that.
She's going to have such a great time. We're going to spend the day together getting all the autographs of all the disney princesses.
shut up buckles.
Woody not only will we take pictures at Space Mountain, i'm going to take your daughter to meet Snow White, her favorite disney princess..
tell em andrew.
Never.

sUN did you actually mean to give Woody a 1 instead of a 10? #magic8.
Rob <3.
*throws spinning top*.
It looks like someone becomes Rob..
i figured.
the fuck is that gif.
Something went wrong.
#gif sUN, when kobe was trying to figure out a number, how did he mistakenly come up with a 10?.

Something went wrong.
#gif tinfoil hat.
WOODY WOULD TELL SUN TO SAY NO.
That settles it.
no.
Sun, is woody fucking with the system #yesorno.
Just ask.
But I have no way of verifying this..
i suspect woody modified kobe so that whenever he asks kobe he gets a 10.
"your right".
he disagrees....
http://i.imgur.com/eTCwx.gif.
#kobe?.
woody you get a 4/10.
mike gets a 8.5/10.
sike he's a great dad.
my father used to hit us, that's not cool.
Like your sister, I can take a lot of abuse.
i dont know why you're the target for my abuse today woody, but here we are.
woody couldnt figure out how to unbend a paper clip.
sicker burn than Mance Rader..
sickest burn this side of the salem witch trials.
when woody was asked in elementary school what he wants to be when he grows up, he wrote "the understudy for the "heart" guy on captain planet".
"good, woody" - Brian.
your right..
Spelling matters.
If your right at all like you right now, it will be bad.
I'll just write insults to an imaginary person I don't know and keep going..
I bet woody doesn't poop in a toilet. He poops in Tupperware and puts it in the trash.
If I'm bored this weekend, I might right some nonsensical fiction that has no plot to it at all.
Santa only has eyes for his bottom bitch.
Santa giving all the ho ho hoes amazing gifts.
I bet Santa gives her amzing gifts.
Cookies? Gifts?.
Being Misses Claus would have a ton of perks.
it is known.
> I'm [...] fucking Chris Kringle -  Woody 2015.
He never figured out why his room was fucking disgusting.
I'm the fucking Chris Kringle of poop packages.
I literally saw max take a poop in a plastic container, hide it in Tim's closet, and he didn't find it until the end of the year..
Woody "The Poopetrator" Zantzinger.
Tim did that to Max a few years ago when I lived with them. It was fucking hilarious..
I'll just poop ON YOUR FACE.
better yet!.
no!.
no wait. Gonna hide it in your moms room.
I'm going to poop in a sack and hide the sack in your room.
The asianess is rubbing off.
OK calm down Chinese woody.
Your children will then be returned to you. Spoiled by my love that you can never give them..
Twist, I'll put all my daughter up for adoption because I only want sons.
I'm going to come to your house while you're at work and leave all your dairy out so that when you come home you have to deal with a bunch of spoiled dairy and that's just gross..
We're gonna take pictures at Space Mountain. Your daughter is going to say, "Jon I wish you were my dad". I'll be like, "I know, I know".
Wow rekt.
I'm going to Disneyworld. And I'm gonna take your future children. We're gonna have fun without you woody..
and then make a pun about Andrew Jackson and say "Sick Burn".
*ok.
I owe you $25 so on.
I'm going to take a $20 bill and burn it and then burn you with it.
Everyone go ahead and give hearts to mike's comments above..
I'm not sure why.
Woody I'm going to buy you six beers then pour them out in from of you.
Jon you're the man.
I'd rather buy 6 beers than the compendium. I like the game, I don't care about the effects. I play fucking Nethack for god's sake.
Elon Musk is the man. .
i guess ill bite the bullet and buy it this time ; damn peer pressure ; anyone doing hard drugs cause im down for that too.
Jon... You're gonna be in for lots of omni.
Axe immortal!?!?.
I bought mine this morning.
This is a fact. Many ducats.
maybe even some quarters.
unless you had a full ride, i'm guessing you gave uva quite a few dimes.
I didn't even give UVA a dime, but I'll buy a compendium lol.
that blackhole does look sweet though....
woody think about all the joy that dota has brought you. this groupchat wouldnt even exist if it werent for dota. don't you think its time you gave back?.
you guys watch this elon musk power wall video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKORsrlN-2k.
Every enigma blackhole is awesome.
You won't, matt.
150 bucks for awesome enigma black hole apparently.
> what hell.
> 10 bugs.
plus more immortals the hype train has no brakes.
man, it's 10 bugs to contribute to a FREE game that we spend like 100s of hours playing. I'll gladly pay it..
0%.
% chance I buy the compendium.
Sand king sand king ms increase to max when playing desert variant of map.
New desert map looks dope.
Octarine was really great on DP cause of the cooldown reduction. 6 second silence with an 8 second CD. And DP needs tankiness which octarine provides. And all it all, it's not that hard to build.

i guess lower cd blink would be nice though.
qop cant perma stun you, and doesnt have a shit ton of hp.
Qop with ocarina and aghs > ogre ocarina and aghs.
that seems really strong.
holy shit, i hadnt even thought of that.

So with LO does your hero actually do the spell back?.

So is it the actual update?.
no.

Other than to just not use the spell you were gonna use.
Stop being a bitch ez.
Is there any way to stop the lotus shit. .
Because it works exactly like you hope it does.
Fun thing is calling Tiny Tony.
Also hilarious is Tony's toss with lotus.
It should bounce over to ypu.
Repel isn't a debug Jon.
Umm I doubt it.
It should repel you.
If you repel someone who has lotus on, does that get rid of it..

they fixed shallow graving wraiths.
maybe get mangos on necro so you can always pop one to heal.
icefraud pls.
>Fixed Combined wards granting 100 bonus HP.
necro also isnt that hard to dive and kill....
i think basically it will be while your lane is pushed on dire you can positon yourself to hurt ancients, and then stack while lane is away from you.
stumarrize it for me.
and at max level no more than 2 min by ancients.
http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=159343.
thats a good point. goodbye offlane tower.
good luck doing that while also having a presence in lane.
lol, it requires you to be in proximity for long periods of time.
you _can_ do it from radiant... much less efficient tho.
only for dire offlane though.
stack ancients.
necro offlane is going to be big.
i think plan will end up being SUPER DEFENSIVE TRI around alchy for like 5 minutes, he gets midas + treads + basi, then they send him off to the jungle.
and then you get the aghs for tiny first, then aa or wd.
or necro.
LD.
neg armor aoe.
and then an offlaner who can get aghs but doesnt need it early.
also, WD and alch are great synergy.
i do think tiny, wd, aa and alch would be good.
ultra kill instead.
hard gaem.
team ganks.
I'm supporting as WD.
^.
ez gaem.
other team ganks alch, the squishiest hero ever, because you have a jungler and one support.
not wit halch!.
oh, you mean alch gets his aghs for him.
lol it'd take 5ever to get an aghs in jungle.
while mid and carry get farmed.
and then he gets agh.
but if it's a #4 tiny.
yeah so... medium efficient.
kind of like a support pudge thing.
it works very well.

oh ok.
tiny jungle? how does he do that? why does he do that? this strategy depends on a decent laning stage for alch.

I think he'll be great with an alch.
did you see tiny jungle?.
i think tiny would be dirty.
yeah we just need to find the perfect lineup to take advantage of it.

and the last one you eat.
and then 2 more.
and then another.
and then you farm another.
like a salve or something i think.
no he feeds it to people.
I'll try too. I'm enjoy supporting and farming. Someone just has to explain what I do with the aghs, if anything. Does he just hold it then everyone has it?.

i can practice.
i'll play aghs, but idk about farming.

Ahh I see.
i know, but the way the venge aura works is that it stays on you until venge respawns. i was curious if it would permantently put the aura on someone because venge hadn't respawned. if it did work like that it would have to be a bug.
Killing a hybrid does not kill morph.
You turn back into morph with whatever health and mana you had before you hybrid when hybrid ends or the hybrid is killed.
probably not.
i wonder if you kill morph while he hybrids venge if you keep the negative aura indefinitely.
although venge illusions do carry the aura.
yeah apparently it does not, you are correct.
i know it gives plus damage, but does the aura itself effect illusions.
No its + dmg.
because if so, tb, venge morphling would be an absurd draft.
question, does venge aura affect illusions?.
if rubik is like playing ability draft, playing morphling is going to be like playing ardm.
You are correct. .
so no adaptive strike until it wears off.
but you would still be mirana.
19 seconds????????.
THE FUCK.
FUCK you could adaptive strike before that and its off CD again at the end.
adaptive strike into real arrow into fake arrow.
My god... Real mirana arrow, fake mirana arrow, adaptive strike. 14.5 seconds of stun.
one of my favorite moments as rubik was stealing sunder, then having a viper gank me, standing there doing nothing until i got low, sundering and killing him.
Also from last night I am reminded that sunder is the biggest fuck you of a spell.
can meepo poof to a morphling who hybrids him? can morphling poof to meepo?.
Copy a mirana. Ez arrow to adaptive strike.
but what if you disrespecfully summon him.
...no way you get to keep a bear.... .
Techies es and omni sound so strong. Tb is cool but that hero is so squish without mega farm.
...that is a really good question.
Can you summon a disrespecful spirit bear? and he stays w you?.
i mean you sacrifice a hero when you pick him, but the stun he has is still really strong, and if you pick the right lineup he would have a lot of flexibility on who to copy depending on the situation.
double edict on lesh for pushing isnt bad.
carries literally cant farm because all creeps are taken.
Double Chen for ultimate army of creeps.
its just so absurdly strong i think.
double vacuum and extra ion shells for ds.
375 bouncing to all tracked targets twice.
double bounty, with the shurakin buff thats a shit ton of damage.
Blink axe shit.
double omni is really good.
Ez 2 bkbs.
Double omni.
with tusk you could make a circle.
lol, yeah if you do it wrong.
Double fissure can be more of a pain in the ass to both sides though.
double fissure.
all of jakiro's non ultimate spells are pretty strong.
speaking of pugna stuff, double blast on towers.
you could have like 10 tb illusions at once with manta on the original tb.
tb illusion, double metamorph.
Double nether ward.
Undy tombstone!.
whose stats does morph get?.
thats obnoxious as shit.
^.
Techies suicide and mine.
really any extra disable.
double hex as lion or ss.
use 2 strong invoker spells.
What are the most broken things new morph can do? Double tombstone is up there I think.
there are so many absurd synergies with the new morph, i think he's gonna be one of the most banned heros in the upcoming patch if only because teams dont know what to expect.
Woody did you know that a new morph illusion can make extra stones for ES?.
No boots dusa more viable.
I just want to able to kick allies too...icefrog pls.

did you test it?.
weird, the post i read says neither gets the damage.
if duel is reflected the winner gets double the reward.
so if doom casts doom on a lotus target, and they have aghs, it might make sense to run at doom.
so apparently spells reflected by the lotus thingy get aghs upgrades based on whether the person who has the lotus has aghs.

best new dunk.
bloodseeker + enigma + tusk. rupture someone, kick them into black hole.
You guys figure out all the combos and figure out what hero yA want me on when I'm back. I'm ready for some tinker NS and alch to farm me aghs.
and if you're REALLY GOOD you can double amp it, so 1400 damage.
There's been a lot of 4+ heart comments today. We're all apparently feeling pretty generous.
60% of 1200 damage, multiplied by a 40% amp, -> 720 * 1.4 = 1008 pure damage.
>infinity damage.
level 2 ES can roll at you, then kick you forever away. jesus chroist. also remember when we tested earth spirit + bloodseeker woody? rupture and stone them, then kick them right before stone expires. infinity damage.
"Hey antimage can you buy back?".
gg.
no buyback.
kill carry EZ before 10 minutes.
also necro.
You could kick someone from the first bounty tune to under the mid tower. Plus ES would actually be able to use the aghs at level 1.
Insta kill anyone with a 40 to 20sec cooldown.
Obviously the best early aghs is lion.
gank on mid becomes 5 min. ultra kill.
I still think tinker.
ES would be most op. You would be able to kick people under tower in any lane from level one.
Coming home in 20. Let's doto.
So can undy tombstone and Phoenix ult and def blast near them = gg.
Literally maphacking.
Nightstalker with the improved nightvision thing is nuts.

big ol' flower of SHUT UP.
what about night stalker and tinker.
cam and i saw it last night, can confirm it's hilarious looking.
I wanna try his blast.
but with no CD.
But then he only can invoke 1 spell.
Who is only balanced by the fact that they're super squishy? The stats at lvl 1 are nothing to joke about.
are there more than earth spirit where the aghs works pre-6? meeps, LD.
Invoker gets invoke at level 2 w reduced cd.
true.
Well thats true for basically all heroes.
but you dont get upgrade until level 6?.
axe would be pretty broken too.
maybe earth spirit? level 1 batrider on steriouds.
Sty on my team lol.
witch doctor.
actually fuck it.
3 Meepos at level 3 though.
tree.
The doctor .
Or ld .
Meepo.
Who would be the most broken hero to start with aghs. I say tree.
"dude, gravity-boost isn't a real thing. stop making shit up, you're high".
planetary tour is the bitchinest idea... "what if we just gravity-boosted around all the planets".
i.e. penises.
WHEN THE PLANETS ALIGN.
skins vs. skin tubes.
Flandro invented grand planetary tour.
I'm down with the reverse captains draft, but why can't it be skins vs. more skin?.
reverse captain's draft, everyone who is drafted (1) has to have an aghs upgrade, and (2) gets to cheat to get an aghs at minute 0.
i dont know who he is, but i like his sense of style.
he just retired finally, but dude was still using iMacs, rolling around in old man sunglasses and sweatsuits.
Mike you may know of him, the list actually belongs to Gary Flandro.

Dear Black People Meat - I also tried to nerf Earth Spirit so you would stop losing 1v1 mid but I could only do so much.
#gif challenge accepted.
Did you see them try to nerf axe? Icefraud wrote me a letter. It said "Dear Blackpeoplemeat, Your Axe too good, Dunks OP. Your omni is good too, but he yells at Dragos and the gay kid too much. Try and go 30-2 now. -Love Icefraud".
Lol core naga siren for 5s net.
But yeah.
I meant euls yourseld.
Euls gets purged.
And euls only saves you for like 2 seconds.
Low cd on the ability though. Only aa ult or euls applies.
Dota Argument, the counter is always Black Hole, Chrone, Euls, AA Ult or Doom.
So even bh refresher doesnt cover you.
And the cd is 40 seconds.
Ok so you basically have to commit a huge ultimate just to stop him from raping your team.
Any argument? There is always black hole.
Black hole!.
Can't purge call.
Chrono to disable but not kill.
Lol.
Chrono.
Call wont work.
Debuff mike.
Duel, berserkers call.
You fear nothing.
Also imagine being unable to be disabled on storm woody.
One of those he no longer cares about.
The only reason you ever buy bkb on huskar is either pure damage or disable.
I dunno, the Invis was so nice for surprise initiate..
Ez dunk.
They'll nerf it.
I think its gonna be broken.
Yes ice blast will help at the end, but its still 8 seconds of huskar not giving a fuck.
Ice blast ez.
He will be at full.
I still don't think its that strong! A single person buff for 7 seconds. Jon (Omni) can get the whole team!.
And thats doubled.
But the amount of heal huskae gets from lifestealing at low health and from his q is insane.
There are things.
no guarantee for full health, damage is still done.
Duel, ice blast, static link, enfeeble, essence shift.
And he is guarenteed full health at the end.
You cant kite him.
How is that fair on huskae.
Otherwise its broken.
Ok so like 2 spells counter it in the whole game.
Jon, omni got a buff.
cast time on heal from .4 to .3.
You can't purge some stuff. Doom, ww ulty.
And of he has lifesteal he heals to full.
Your carry is untouchable for 8 seconds.
Because there are moves that go through bkb.
Aight I'd missed that. Intriguing. .
I still don't think its OP.
Its more than that though.
Its basically BKB and Dazzle in one move.
Aka legion w aghs Andy.

Nope. Item too expensive. He's not gonna get it. .
And yeah, but in pubs he's gonna be the new es.
Oracle, yes. .
Im talking about oracle.
How do you see pick and win rate by skill? Isn't there a way.
Im confused what you're talking about.
In any case he's not in CM. not relevant.
I ain't seen it.
...?.
And high level players do complain about him.
octarine core, soul booster + mystic staff.
Its his normal ult.
WOODAY REMEMBER.
What item? Its not aghs.
I play him a lot.
He has strong moves, I don't think he is OP.
The item is retardedly expensive andy.
It already was, now its insane.
How often do we play against an oracle and birch about it?.
He isn't.
Bullshit, that hero is so broken.
I don't think oracle is that overpowered... Doesn't get abused at high level play or complained about.
Or slark.
Or an ursa.
Thats so broken.
You die.
How do you deal with a storm?.
How do you deal with a huskae with that on him?.

but he can be lategame. free recall on 3s CD is free splitpush, radiance gives evasion, bkb-piercing root. i think you can play him different.

And he can kick things really hard. .

While everyone is focused on the crazy new combos, I'm going to build eBlade, Aghs Pudge. They'll never expect it.
tusk aghs is brokenly fun, the other team will ragequit because they're not having as much fun as tusk.
LD*.
Yea I'm gonna practice my lad.
Lone druid aghs is broken IMO.
They'll have the best ideas.
also lone druid aghs is dirty beyond reason.
I can't wait to watch pros .
I CANT WAIT TO DOTO.
you can get a midas at less than 2 minutes if you get freefarm + rune.
categories: (1) needs aghs, hates to waste the slot [tiny, meepo], (2) wouldn't normally buy aghs but would be nice to have [sven, luna], (3) poor ass supports [tree, lion, AA].
ill farm an aghs for your meep any day.
Meepo*.
I still think alch and merlo is gonna be dirty.
mother of god.
then clones techies, both drop mines and supporf suicides and kills the person then comes back as morph.... gg.

(not easy on all of them, i guess. tree could farm it).
things that temper that: farming aghs is not easy on any of these heroes, alch still has to have the space to farm these aghs for other heroes, and the new intelligence items are super expensive.
that was be hilarious.
Brood builds a huge spider wave (15+) and charges the offlane tower alone. Aghs NP ults and counters with new 15+ tree force.
My initial reaction to this patch without having played it is that its completely stupid..
team "hit it and quit it".
like you were never even there.....
I'm coming up with some new disrespectful plays. I like the Morph + SB + Lifestealer Combo. Duplicate SB, get SB in LS, LS in SB copy. Charge someone, every one expodes out, use SB ult, Hop back together and charge back out.
Boom bop bing, ba-da-bing-bob-pow.
Sweet dolla tea from McDonalds, Brian drinks that..

I mean i can play on the touchpad in crappy internet and still win if ya want.

Pudge slow scales. Woot. Brian when are we 1v1 pudge?.
Everyone is X with and alch.
Weaver is offlane with an alch.
>Tusk kept going and crashed!.
>The attack missed!.
>Tusk used Hi Jump Kick!.
i want a tusk change where if you kick someone while they're in the air from punch, they go even further.
I would like to request a video of lina Laguna herself.
Also lotus orb and the core whatever are expensive as FUCK.
Don't ignore that it's super fucking hard for supports to farm an aghs. Weaver won't be a support. .
I'll get into it later but lo is super hard to use because you have to manually cast it, it's not like linkens.
Also can Weaver be a support? Rush aghs, max bugs?.
Icefrog pls.
Can you buy a blade mail against LO too effectivly double nukes? Dagaon -> LO -> Self Dagon -> Reflect back is like 1600 damage.
Self dunk might be the new meta for disrespect.
like seriously, everyone is going to by this LO.
Disrespectful self dunk.
axe can dunk himself.
Love the Batrider Lotus Orb. Everyone is lassoed, no one can move.

both with like 3k life.
maybe a legion with enfeeble and supporfling that deals no damage.
perfectly balance lifesteal between two heroes with equal attack speed? just duel FOREVER.
Who can theory craft the longest duel without spells (like Bane getting involved).

Exactly holy shit.
Easy solution, break up with your girlfriend for doto.
I would pick tinker and new BoTs to first place .
Give me aghs when I play tinker. I'd never get it, but Ez bouncing laser and 4 rockets.
I'm so pissed I'm missing all of this.
Centaur for that ult.
I'd go with IO. You could just tether your way to the top..
If dota heroes were mario kart character choices.
If someone made that a mod.
bumper balls on mario party..
I wish we could play Mario Party on steam as a group, or Smash Bros.
When does the update take effect.
Apparently you can turn morph into wisp and infinite tether/heal .

impromptu ability draft.
half of me wants it left in for the gamebreakingly stupid shit that could happen.
>new meta.
rofl.
ty for the testing mike, this is all wonderful.
need at least 5 slots. yeah this is gonna get patched out.
thats gonna need a fix.
TA got spell steal.
...well.
something is fucky.... centaur lost his ult entirely lol.
if he doesnt cancel.
omg thats actually so good against sniper since you have time to react.
see if it is different.
once again try on a hero with less actives than doom.
interesting.
stealing a move just replaces steal????.
wait nope i have steal on doom now wtf.
Ha ha ho hrgrhrgrhrhehrgh.
Also will love reflecting assassinate back down snipers bitch ass throat.
can't reproduce lotus orb / rubick.
might get patched though.
yes.

does octarine orb reduce item cds?.

lotus orb is going to be sleeper OP as dick, too.
Wk is going to be a fun hero now too.
you're doing gods work mike.
> i am testing it.
its ok i wanted to feel like shit at work tomorrow anyways.
and if it doesnt work with doom try it on a hero with less spells.
please test.
i dont know. i should go to bed but this is too fucking funny.
what happens when he uses lift and you try to steal it?.
its gotta get patched out but thats fucking funny.
....
http://i.imgur.com/bhcXQZ8.jpg.
you can steal spells after?.
wait what?.
if you use lotus orb and rubick spell steals you, you spell steal his spell steal.
playing against bristle with him was the least fun.
yes? dont pick huskar.
no? pick huskar.
do they have physical damage?.
i think huskar is always gonna be situational.
I think huskar is going to be shown more too.
just spent like ten minutes kicking a centaur around the map. tusk new batrider confirmed.
get some mobility items and he can disrupt fights.
Gotcha.
12 seconds for both punch and kick.
Without wtf mode?.
hitmonchan + hitmonlee confirmed.
i think if you really practice with tusk he could be a very good high skill hero.
Is there a cool down on it?.
actually thats a legit point... blink punch kick.
you can get someone out of position.
need to be able to kick allies so you can go no-boots medusa and kick her into battle.
i mean its a batrider situation.
it does zero damage, but stuns through BKB.... this is useless but fucking hilarious.
shitty earth spirit aghs confirmed.
roll in kick back.
clowniest hero confirmed.
tusk can kick people across the river.
i cant wait to see the alch strats.
nvm watching an alch poop out an aghs every 8 minutes or so.
Glowballs unstoppable.
Spectre even more op.
Pl radiance op.
17% miss chance.
Also radiance is insane as an item now.
i bet it gets patched.
he dies lol.
Does he get health and stun?.
Fuck.
http://imgur.com/a/jBrSj.
yes.
Can doom devour mud golems?.
Wait.
haven't seen an effective alch yet in any of these matches ive watched.
counters bkb.
true.
And shuts down a whole team.
Disruptor aghs is so good but hard to get.
Dirtiest combo.
Disruptor, alch, and Zeus.
luna aghs.
maybe like aghs for a sven?.
Position 0 alch.
truth.
i think the biggest parts are (1) aghs for supports who can't farm, and (2) aghs for carries who want the slot back.
sd?.
tree, bane.
which heroes could never farm aghs usually.
12 min bane aghs?.
12 minute witch doctor aghs.
yeah with the right heros around him that could be good.
the early aghs could be so gamebreaking.
it at the very least needs to be tried.
i think there's a legitmate case to be made for position 1 support alch.
or any other hero.
or offlane cent.
neither does your offlane clock.
mid tiny doesnt have to farm aghs.
new golem camp = 6 last hits for alch.
support position one alch.
jesus.
strat: protect alch for 4 minutes, let him get midas + treads, then let someone else take safelane and farm. alch farms aghs for everyone with fat stacked camps. can you imagine a 12 minute tree aghs?.
if he copies techies do his mines stay up?.
if morph copies a tree with aghs, do his trees stay up after he becomes normal again?.
ez 400 gold bounty rune.
cam and i did LD + alch bot match. 12 minute midas phase maelstrom :o.
Cinematics are the best. Also im high on how high definition that is..

new shadowblade item sleeper OP.
nyx aghs ulty fucking too good.
watching matches in test client. this is no longer dota.
andy is a great example of a great friend..
Int heroes op .
played zeus with oct core + aghs + refresher in bot match. WTF this hero???? 4.5s 350dmg nuke..
tiny is a great example.
its gonna be good on a support/utility alch to help out heros who are item slot starved and dont want to have to buy aghs.
10 min go.
Necro mid rushes Dagon and gets aghs from alch.
Is he rushes aghs and gives it to tiny or someone.
It's still pretty cool.
Yea.
i didnt realize that.
he cant keep getting stats.
ok, alchs thing only works once per hero.
Stu for president..
Lifestealer .
Yes.
did you download the test patch?.
Which seems to be maxed out.
From my initial testing you can get alch to be at 0.17 second per attack.
Greevils Greed on alchemist lvl 1 and getting bounty is hilarious.
"Feed".
Give mangos to enemy carry.

/r/dota2smut.
Black holes for days.
request: rule 34 picture of lion fingering 5 female dota heroes at once.
The 25% cool down reduction is stupid.
I'll spam 4/20 blaze it afterwards.
I need to see someone eat a ward with a tango.
thats crazy..
wait so it is all allied heroes get the aghs?.
you will get reported for not buying aghs for supports.
never pick alch when solo in pubbs.
What? It's single target still with the alch aghs.
Alch techies lesh meta.
I want to see a dota comic of alch eating things.
Yeah Jon, not just someone, but everyone.
He can also just eat it for stats.
Everyone.
Cool that now you can remove chilling touch by clicking the buff above your health bar.
DIdnt see the alch aghs until now. I don't understand. He's basically buying an aghs for someone?.
Because no one would check that shit.
So we will never know.
i assume there will be a buff indicator.
Maybe they'll get an icon or something above them.
when lion fingers 5 of them at once.
10/10 reference.
When alch applies aghs to a hero, how will the other team know?.
Bears. Beats. Battlestar Galatica..
I think I'm in love with Ursa..
 Question .
sing is talking about the Ursa shit..
I think aghs is great on her, but still the nerf doesn't really do that much cause you can get up close with euls.
we'll see how it plays out.
i'm very happy with the patch so far.
lina, the one broken hero i play got only a small nerf to aghs which was an item i dont like building on her anyway.
Big nerfs to jug..
yeah: sniper, troll, jugg, storm, axe.
Ho ho ha ha!.
The heroes I wanted got the nerfs they deserved I think.
It is the dawn of a new game.
I want that in my life..
Cent is so great now.
Mike, you should also do the walrus kick now.
he is a lot of fun.
i play him sometimes.
Someone should play him..
he does so much dps.
he will be unkillable.
i was just thining that jon.
Yeah, if theres ever a time for someone to try and make Leshrac a thing. It's now..
(glowballs).
You could have a 4 caster line-up and be completely gucci.
huskar still nerfed :(.
Dunno why they haven't tried to give more physical damage heroes more weight..
I think you could keep 2-3 creeps stacked with ult.
Clinkz*.
Or on clinks.
10 s cool down on ult.
Octarine on alch .
Its a casters buff update.
Mines EVERYWHERE.
AND KOTL.
dont ever speak those words again.
Techies octarine orb aghs.
techies is going to be meta with that chance. promise it..
shits gonna get out of control.
but if you have a 50+ min game.
"oh did you want this lane of rax? no, this is my lane of rax".
i think the changes to normal games are gonna be minimal.
late game dota is gonna be nuts.
Incoming 500 minute games.
Techies aghs makes base defense so crazy.
luna aghs upgrade is fucking tits.
wait no skaddi from side shop. nvm..
idk if yall talked about this, but lone druid aghs upgrade makes him the rat lord of all rat lords.
(moreso AM really jon).
Big nerf to scythe. No longer has break.
you can get a Skaadi straight from the side shop.
side shop*.
as a PA player.
you know how nice thats gonna fucking be.
omg voidstone in the sideshow.
holy fucking nuts, can you imagine that + supportphling?.
things of note: KOTL cooldown reduction BORDERLINE FUCKIGN IMBA.
just caster's buff.
"have you ever seen someone come to a fight with a fucking mango???".
sing sing: "a support comes into a fight and spoon feeds a zeus a mango".
And buff supports.
New meta is attack speed.
YOU GET A LIKE YOU GET A LIKE YOU GET A LIKE.
FUCK i was playing dota while yall were chatting about doto. 1000 messages.
Yeah octane orbs are retarded. Everyone is gonna be building that shit..

Now I'm sitting at a fucking 7-11 listening to sing. What is this updating doing to the world..
He's top streamer on dota right now.
Excited to hear his reaction about the moon glave shit.
Link.
His reaction about lotus is exactly mine.
Watching. .
watching sings reaction now.
yeah a bunch are reading it on stream.
Any twitchers casting about it yet Andy?.
then esl frankfurt.
the summit will be the first big tournament with the new patch.
Just sat in this garage for like an hour .
Bet there's a lot of revisions along the way. They had to have fucked up somewhere .
Yeah. A lot to introduce before the international..
i dont even understand dota.
and all these consumable items.
the new boots though.
Expensive for a support though: 4050. The pieces are nice. Perseverance rings are so nice..
And the mana regen is sick.
You can echo so much cool shit. Imagine lotus-ing a Laguna blade, doom, finger etc..
wtf.
these new items are nuts.
You could fuck over a doom so hard. Just mirror the doom. .
Looks like a sick skill item. .
The echo is crazy..
lotus orb looks ntus.
You could just yolo into rosh so hard from the dire side.
You can erase their jungle if you spread out property.
And you can go over cliffs? Hilarious..
Centaur aghs is crazy. Damage reduction and you can run over trees. We surprise buttseks a team so hard. .
I wanted to attend that..
Sty is going to 'Stomp Some Scrubs'.
Andy Esposito is not going to 'Stomp Some Scrubs'.
Sty created event 'Stomp Some Scrubs' https://s.groupme.com/7qKsybZu.
Disrespectfully of course.
Someday I see myself hilariously building a refresher on him. Gonna yolo so hard..
Yeah the cooldown is interesting. .
go ham.
wait to respawn.
die in the middle of their team.
Dawn of the Junglers/Supps/GlowBalls.
save it for aeigis respawn.
more late game.
I like it and seems balanced.
and long cooldown.
4 sec duration tho.
He already eats nubs for breakfast. Now its gonna be for lunch dinner and elevensies. .
Pretty sure Ursa is gonna pub stomp harder than you've ever seen before.
i want to like stus comment more times.
watching sing read the patchnotes.
Tusk = Captain Falcon.
and yeah the new ursa ult looks broken as shit.
Tusk officially clowniest hero.
lol at walrus kick.
80%??? I'm sorry were you hitting me???.
That's crazy isn't it?.
Ursa goes into a frenzy, causing him to take 80% less damage from any source and for his attacks to deal 2/2.5/3 times the Fury Swipes damage. Removes any existing debuffs upon cast..
I think I'm gonna be playing more ursa now. I think the new ult is crazy. .
literally all the strenght.
I like the rasta buff.
Every jungler ever does.
Makes playing SK and enigma easier. .
I like that mud golums aren't spell resistant anymore. .
New disrespect: buy basher on troll and void when winning.
ooo yeah the fuck'em. Never loved them. .
Itd just be a very strange damage item for him.
Bash doesn't proc though.
Troll can buy basher now.
i keep checking the url to make sure this isnt a prank.
Is that more crazy than you can EAT THEM..
The amount of times I've missed a ward 10 times then gotten Pudge hooked and killed.
YOU NO LONGER MISS ATTACKING WARDS UPHILL.
Valve is high. .
until you kills a hero and get GIANT TREES.
omg you can eat wards with tangos.
Guys. Glowballs wins TI5.
Ez farm.
Just send them all into jungle.
the np aghs i think might be bad because it could feed treents.
Quelling blade OP too. New build for battlefury. .
how many times are people gonna fuck up the new ward system too.
Octarine core on everyone in glowballs.
New boots of travel makes Tinker cooler again. .
glow balls is BACK.
Fuckin nuts..
Octarine core is nuts.
It's a hefty price to skip aghs and refresher.
AND IT DEDUCES COOLDOWNS BY 25%???.
trees EVERYWHERE.
and hilarious.
furion aghs is also awesome.
He has to get the item first though.
i dont know what to believe anymore.
Reeling on this fucking spell lifesteal on Zeus. That seems so fucking stupid..
alch is going to be op.
Guys. TI5 is going to be wack.
I like enchanted mango.
Yeah Zeus lifesteals on fucking ult? How is that fair?.
Solar crest is sweet. .
Zeus Octarine core is OP as hell.
I like it.
Octarine core will be core on all carry casters.
Shards can be a 4300 gold consumable. Hilarious. .
2 tombstones.
things that would be broken for the new morphling: undyings tombstone.
ez.
+240 attack speed.
farm 4.

Moon shard is interesting. You can fucking eat it. .
Guardian greaves are sweet.
I'm sitting in a fuckin parking lot reading these updates. Need the info now..

The Ursa rework is interesting..

Alch buff.

items are coolio too.
also WK aghs.
These new items are interesting..
cast on any ally.
weaver aghs cool too.
Our world devoured aghs is sweet.

lifestealer aghs is super neat.
Duel lasts until either legion commander or her target dies.
Omg.
Legion aghs.
cool guys dont look at explosions.
Lookout.
Kinka no longer turns to torrent, uh oh.
Chakra Magic now adds a buff that that reduces the cooldown of the next spell its target casts by 1/2/3/4 seconds. Buff lasts 12 seconds..
omg that's cool..

So this is the update hm.

Incapacitating Bite is no longer a Unique Attack Attack Modifier.
*2nd.
and thats the first hero.
my mind is blown.
he gets infinite stats eventuallY?.
super cool.
he farms for all his supports?.
Alchemist can now cast Aghanim's Scepter to directly grant any allied hero all Aghanim's Scepter bonuses as a buff (the hero upgrade and the stat upgrade). The scepter is consumed in the process. Multiple instances of this buff do not stack. Alchemist can target himself as well.
wtf is that shit.
why did you not mention the alch aghs upgrade.
I CLICKED THE GODDAMN BLINK YOU SON OF A BITCH.

sUN, do you fake it with any of us? #yesorno.
Whew...
no.
sUN has every girl faked it on me? #yesorno.
yes.
Did she sUN? #yesorno.
She didn't fake the orgasm I gave her last night.
What do you MEAN Cersei isn't fake? She faked her love for Robert Baratheon and also faked that he fathered her children. Her and Jamie faked to her father the whole time that they were just regular siblings and not butt buddies. She faked to Sansa that she'd be safe in Kings Landing. Faked to Ned Stark that he'd be safe. She's as fake as they come..

She's totally a silent and dead fish in bed who cries.
Then stick it in her butt and say, sike naww.
I'd be all, bitch I ain't gonna double cross you.
sansa for the sad sex?.
I'd probably throw in Sansa somewhere in the mix .
Denarys over everyone. Then cersei then Margery. I'm w job.
Margery's been acting like a real hoe .
Cersei has some salt but at least she's not fake. .
Margaery is the hottest woman in the show.
Jon. What is wrong with you.
I think I'd pick Cersei over Margery Tyrell.
You probably shouldn't tho....
I want a double baconator from Wendy's .
I want a double
Aghs in this new update.

Remember when we played in one of the top viewed games in dota? Pepperidge farm remembers. .

classic andy move.
My reply is no.
but will he stay out #magic8.
Most likely.
This week on Rise from the Ashes, will Andy get out? #magic8.
Dan needs mags too. Shits expensive.
get right the fuck out.
god fucking damnit andy.
who Dan? yeah probably..
Or maybe he was just horny.
It's okay Brian. We're all friends here now..
I heard thats good luck stu.
Brian bought condoms for his boyfriend. Who happens to be Dan. We've kept his secret by calling him Danielle..
Unicorn jizzed on mah car.
Was just at Walmart. Bought condoms and a protein bar. Chick was like da fuck?!.
You just couldnt handle my superstar talent.
should have tried harder to dumb it down, we still didnt understand shit.
Or maybe the best one :).
You would make an awful rape victim andy. "dont remember it so it didn't happen".
I was probably just having to dumb it down for you.
andy you were batting 0.500 on lyrics, but definitely hitting an 11 on volume.
Everyone is on fucking Fire today. Once of the best days of GroupMe.
I dont remember it so it didnt happen.
andy i've heard you try to sing along to lupe fiasco while drunk, you dont even know all the words.
nvm desktop version messing with me..
And im not the one who gets scared when walking through neighborhoods with a lot of black people mike.
what is that sUN error from. Is it from andy using trill based on how white he is?.
Something went wrong.
#gif hilt it and quilt it.
At least i know what trill means.
god get fuckin rekt andy.

Hm. I'd like to see what sUN thinks about andy's whiteness.

i had to urbandictionary that. #kobe how white am i.
I guess sUN doesn't recognize.

Well played though. Trill respects trill..
ENOUGH..
HEY.
Sounds like something Tobias would say.
idk "Jon Gabriel" is up there.
The comic series that's from, Boy Commando's, has to be one of the worst names i've ever heard..
it actually says that in the article. Only his feet remained.
He dies when someone shot him so many times with a shotgun all that remained was his feet.
Why the fuck does Quilt-man have to "kidnap" a surgeon to try and help his vision.
classic woody thing to do, though.
Thats some dark shit.
Mike, that villain was killed, returned as a ghost to cause his cousin to miscarry so he could possess the dead baby.
This quiltman villain is so fucking bad.
aka Buckles.
woody would be http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abattoir_(comics) because he likes marrow.
http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Buckle_the_Mountain_Man.
Everyone knows this is why Matt is Buckles.
Everyone look out he might smoke some weird flower then try to turn eveyones water into a super drug to scare people.
Matt would be some sort of weird villain who only uses buckles.
LOL.
Woody would be knight rider .
ENOUGH..
HEY.
Your def a Ras-al-goul because your plans suck.
jon would be clayface because he has an ugly face.
Bored in class. Gonna read this whole crazy quilt wiki article now.
Also, quilt don't come with background checks.
Who needs batman when you can just get a gun..
Jon, have you seen how crazy that quilt is?.
It looks like a shitty knock off version of scare crow.
batman doesnt kill.
I never understood why you couldn't just shoot someone like that with a gun.
O . o.
Maybe he's the normal universe Hitler and we have the alternate Crazy Quilt.
alternate universe hitler?.
> Crazy-Quilt is a noted painter who leads a double-life as a master criminal..
"Crazy-Quilt has a helmet that allows him to hypnotize his victims using flashing lights of various colors. It can also project lethal laser beams, blinding lights, and functions as artificial eyes since his own eyes no longer function; the lenses feed their input signal straight into his brain.".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Quilt.
After some research i've decided I would be "Crazy Quilt".
matt would def be mr freeze, because, well, Canada.
If we're choosing anyone they'd like to be, I'd like to continue to be Omniknight.
i feel like andy would be the riddler, especially if he had a mild psychotic break. he nearly always speaks in puns already. if you give him a reason to be super evil, he'd just have evils puns. ez supervillain.
Can I be Harley Quinn .
I would like to be Ras-al-goul instead of the Riddler.
Sexy.
Woody would Poison Ivy or whatever that chicks name is.
Drago is two face. ez.
Andy is classic Scarecrow.
Brian would be Mr. Freeze.
would be Stu.
Pete and repeat are sitting on a bench. Pete fell off who is left..
Penguin.
Mike would be the Joker.
Jon is the riddler.
but then again who knows, maybe that means a lot of dota tonight.
no dota tonight..
Either way, fun 3v3s tonight me thinks.
get the fuck out of here andy.
3v3 kotl would be a very manared game.
kotl take mana :(.
3v3 kotl mana leak only.
and can only buy radiance.
only aura and other passive, no rightclicking.
3v3 necro only level the aura.
you mean 3 v. 3 Freestyle Basketball 2?.
So are we doing 3v3 venomancer only, plague wards only game tonight?.

New startup, smart condoms. The hottest new thing in wearables.
Still think pebble is the only wearable remotely worth it.
But, Jonny G, you don't even have any money.
as the big sausage pizza guy.
I will volunteer Brian in andy's production.
Unsurprisingly, we were super drunk so I forget the bet.
Also I definitely won a bet against Andy one time, and he has to produce a porn.
probably..
You guys think Ariana Grande has played with the apple watch.
yes.
Is playing with the apple watch also a euphemism for jacking it #yesorno.
I don't believe in wearables.
Just played with the Apple Watch. 6/10, Meh.
most likely you have jacked it to a similar porn plot as well.
Also do you have pics of this spanish teacher. If not creep. Pls. For science..
what the hell is wrong with me..
whats weird was I wasn't grossed out by Mike's jacking it comment but was definitely grossed out by woody's snuggling-porn comment.
there's like snuggling brothels even.
They definitely do. .
Do they make snuggling porn? I could have been the star.
but it had the most sex....
I can assure my college life was likely the least porn like of everyones. I was in a happy relationship the entire time.....
She gave you a B..... j right.
Not to be weird but I've definitely jacked it to a similar plot line.
this is definitely a porn.
but then she gave me a B anyway.
I decided to just get a C.
I didn't go not because she was weird but because I was lazy and didn't want to extra credit.
D+.
So instead of her giving you a C, you'd give her the D?.
I didn't think of the hitting on aspect until like 2 months later.
I asked if I could make up the missed classes somehow, extra credit came up, this is when her house came up.
She said that each missed class over the 3 was a 3% deduction off my final grade, which was going to move me from a B to a C.
Met with her after class to discuss impact of absences..
Ok, so..

You are allowed 2 (3?) absenses.

She wanted your penis. .
k. now acknowledge my request.
2 Years later when I was donating blood she approached me and gave me a massive hug. I had 0 idea who she was but talked to her for about 5 minutes on how I was doing.
wait more woody. context and more dialogue.
Also I like that (1) was fuck Spanish, (2) was erika.
She said there would be wine, I'm not even kidding.
Woody that is like mike-level of not knowing someone is hitting on you.
but she did invite me to her house once.
and I'm 99% sure she also didn't have a thing for me.
I once had a Spanish teacher who I think had a thing for me. I never acted it on it cause fuck Spanish and you know, I'm in love with Erika.
*love, whatever.
Gotta hate getting raw dogged.
She worked me like a dog though but I didn't mind.
My honours supervisor in my undergrad was hot.
I wonder how much more attention i'd pay if a smokin hot chick was teaching.
Has anyone ever had a hot teacher before.
In class, teacher said "get good information". All I heard was "get good" in dota lingo.
and they won.
zeus suicided with bloodstone with io tethered to pa and he was healed up fully.
I would be interested to see that number too.
I would assume so.
and is part of the cut Valve is taking going to go towards the original game makers?.

Andy: if you and Liz haven't been arrested yet, then I don't think intelligence is a factor for bestiality.
Yeah its hilarious.
did anyone watch that? super funny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA2VPU-VVIk.
It might not be beastiality, but it is definitely bestiality.
Or does bestiality require a significant difference in intelligence?.
Does cross species sex count as bestiality? Because if so then daycare breeding definitely counts.
Woody when you're right you're right.
pokemon daddy?.
Aren't they the same thing?.
False, "Pokemon Master".
"beastiality instigator" might be the best thing to put on a business card and hand out.
maybe he was a beastiality instigator / pimp.

Oh your kid never calls? That stinks. Neither does mine. But he is in space....

I think the parents of astronauts must be the proudest. They can win any parent argument.

Seeing as Jon isn't my dad I don't think they can ever be the best.
We could train them to be the very best...the best there ever was.
ariana gabriel will produce lots of cute babies preferably 5 for a full dota team.
Jon have you sent the letter yet?.
Now that Ariana is single he needs to be prepared.
jon is researching parenting role models already.
Just like in real life, I don't think I could take on a black dude in fighting. .
But then again thats probably what david thinks.
I watched the new mortal combat streams too and a lot were black dudes. .
I dont think this is a david monent, I just noticed it.
maybe your just a racist fuck.
Niggas stole my n64.
Its just weird to me. You look at a lot of games and its almost all white and asian streamers and then for this one game its like all black streamers. .

I think at that point I started throwing up on myself. Ez hospital. Ez help. .
Police were like, that dude is probably hella hammered. In my mind I bet I was like, heart of a champion. Ez. .
Apparently I split a handle of vodka with my boy. Went with them and threw a football at the tailgate. I dove for a overthrown ball head first into concrete..
So I was like, you know who I am? They were like yeah we were with you last homecoming. Dumbfounded to any knowledge of last year I was like, what happened???.
Jon pls continue.

I need a knew verity master. What hero does no one play? Leshrac?.
He is less flashy than omni but a lot of utility thanks to the shield debuff.
its seem like its a variation of omniknight. ive never really payed any attention to abaddons.
I also like that he has a ton of salt. My kind of player. "Drow can you stop being a fucking vegetable".
I dont like that his twitch chat is making fun of his weight.

Pokemon? Such try hard.
Shit was mega disrespect.
I'd send him out first, normally would be up against a like level 100 charizard, he'd attack me, I wouldn't die, eat berry, go back to full HP. Then I'd poison him with toxic, refresh my berry, and watch these level 100 pokemon die to a level 1 magnemite.
and it was really strong.
idk remember exactly but it got passed to some evolution of evee.
it ups special attack a shit ton i think.
whats that one move that the firey butterfly has?.
Man, so I had a level 1 magnemite with sturdy (so he couldn't die) a move that restored whatever berry you had (I gave him the berry that would restore like 30hp, so it'd bring him back to full health) and toxic.
i played against some baton pass ones and i'm pretty sure i lost most.
Pokerus and all that jazz.
I have a friend who has a completed pokedex and ev trained the fuck out of his team .
Yeah baton pass teams were stupid.
Did you see the guy who had a team with a bunch of baton passes and made an op magikarp.
that game taught me how little i knew about competitive pokemon.

Yeah Andy, there were a few games like it I think.
because if so then yes.
It was super competitive, and you'd see some really cool teams.

Dedede, throw spiked mystery thing, jump in the air to butt slam. Hammer smash finish.
his up smash was absurd.
jon will agree with me when i say that lucas was the shit.
Pika-fire, baseball bat to the face, ez yoyo for disrespect.
olimar was terrible.
thats the way to play.
Oilmar OP.
random heros on hyrule temple.
Or ness.
get off my lawn.
Not the n64 bullshit.
*here.
your your dedede ass out of her.
pikachu was imba in 64.
I'll will stomp all in brawl .
Come get rekt by pikachu nerds.
More like super stupid.
i do wanna play some brawl.
Stupid? More like amazing.
so earth spirit?.
Nah it has to stun.
Remember in Brawl when they added that stupid trip mechanic?.
make it a silence instead of a stun?.
F that.
They should make a banana peel mechanic .
nailed it.
Green shell rune: skill shot that stuns / damages, BUT can bounce off cliffs and will hit the person who fired it 95% of the time.

off the top of my head: alito, scalia, kennedy, cheif justice roberts, kegan, sotamayor, ginsberg.
And fucking hilarious with the Mario kart runes.
Sorry.
yeah matt, know your justices.
lol found the canukc.
Also, I can see them increasing the CD on trolls ult. Shit is stupid low..
Who's alito?.
pretty sure alito hasn't weighed in on a shrapnel nerf yet.
Unless they reduce the health cost.
Even if huskar gets buffed that will mean that AA will get picked / banned in every game.
not positive but i think there was a supreme court case.
I can see a shrapnel nerf incoming, they either reduce the AOE or increase cooldown.
i'm fairly certain that even given the laws on the books, the only crimes punishable by death are murder.
Hearts for everyone.
"because I successfully argued my way out of that relationship" lol.
Actually it may be porcupine.
You also can't have sex with a hedgehog.
that seems like it was created in response to something specific.
Abandoning a Person to die of smallpox is also a capital crime in Virginia.
Grab a necklace off a dead body? They put you down for that.
Grave robbing is a capital crime in Georgia.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6rjQ9VVLDI.
but the live action rendition!.
I enjoy some songs but definitely less. I dunno just imo.
808s was where he started to get darker, rhymes less wholesome and positive .
i agree with jon on kanye.
a live action rendition of the coldest winter music video.
meh.
but.
how much would you pay for 808s and heartbreaks?.
If he did his other stuff I mean .
Right now though I wouldn't pay dick. .
Unrelated: if kanye west did a tour where he just did Graduation, Late registration and older I'd pay upwards of $500 to go.

FALCON PUNCH!!!!.
i think it was a-up, jump, a-down and then sleep.
in 64 captain falcon was my favorite.
it did so much damage.
she was good if you could nail the fall asleep move.
^^ and it bounces off walls and stuff.
A skill shot rune like a green shell would be so sick.
best disrespectul play was getting really good at jigglypuff, nobody ever expects the puff.
where i stand a mile away and blow people up with my zelda fireballs.
i want wii version.
i take pride in that.
you're too good at that game.
no, its not fun playing with you.
smash64?.
actually no, i want to play smash.
i kinda just want to play mario kart now.
he's a chain chomp not a philosopher.
I enjoy where my retarded random cheese idea took us.
*wandering.
also a wondering chain chomp.
and they can't jump that fucking gap so you win the race.
If you trample them with Centaur ult they get flattened.
And very tiny.
a zeus ult rune that also makes everyone on the other team weaker for a short period of time.
A star rune gives 300% attack damage, 50% speed and invulnerable.
LOL andy spot on.
and fake runes that explode.
also bananas to make the other heros slip.
Runes that did burst speed like mushrooms in mario kart would be hilarious.
waits outside of pucks phase shift.
like the blue shell cant be disjointed.
Only targets the top networth hero on the other team.
mario kart blue shell cheese: one targetable bkb-piercing stun.
Also makes the game hilarious.
Gives incentive for turtles to leave the shell / quicker games.
Would make fighting at roshan more epic later in the game.
basically just make the cheese a better version of a rune: haste cheese, DD cheese, normal cheese is just a better regen rune.
rng cheese would be awesome.

how will he be buffed.
also BH.
i dont entirely understand how undying or his aghs ulty work so i cannot comment.
> twombstones.
zombies around ulted undyingg?.
2 tombstones?.
what will it be.
undyign aghs buff.
i still love jakrio. if i can get a decently timed euls ez game.
remember when jakiro and sb were the meta?.
"why when i was a child, there was a parade every day. those were dark times....".
remember that time when there was an ogre in every game? those were fun times.
ult orb is probably the right choice. stacking stats seems to be meta.
Thats more important.
Nerf to aghs though.
Although recipe again.
im ok with that.
Nerf to bloodstone.
But yeah sheep will still be more.
how about increase cost of point booster?.
They could fix linkens by adjusting recipe cost.
when a mommy linkens loves a daddy linkens.
how do you make a linkens?.
wait.
and Linkens.
that nerfs sheep too i guess.
Make ultimate orbs cost more. Nerf to all agi heroes.
1/2 slow through bkb?.
the slow will be nerfed.
I think skadi will also be nerfed.
his AGI gain is stupid.
And he benefits a lot from that.
The extra agi is nice though.
definitely.
i dont like the change they made to diffusal where level 2 burns less mana, i thought that was a PL nerf.
Aghs pl makes it so that every attack on a hero has a 100% chance of giving another illusion.
illusions deal pure damage.
+1 armor.
what would be a sweet ass pl buff?.
my prediction is fucked ever since they changed him around.
global sniper ulty.
riki aghs buff incoming.
what new aghs buffs will we see.
more important.
ez unkillable.
woody: buy a euls or bkb.
maybe LD and lc too.
He's awesome against slow, which Stu says is the current meta. I don't think he's OP. Any silence fucks him up and he is super dependant on magical damage.
Ds is too weak right now.
I'm talking 1.
but as a 3 or 4.
NS is already meta.
ns and ds too.
i remember the lina game i played where the slark went skadi + satanic because he was so tired of laguna blade.
Lol, i doubt it stu but i hope you're right.
also core kotl.
I don't think Storm is as strong as everyone thinks.
nd riki.
and pl.
CK.
Obviously lina is good.
Yeah i think storm is really strong right now.
Seriously though storm spirit meta incoming.
She's balanced tho, qop.
melee tanks.
But as a result of his nerf, heros he countered became strong.
and tanks.
basically ranged int carries.
I see her in way more games.
QoP seems to be getting way popular.
I know he wasnt popular because he countered them, that wasnt my point.
Huskar meta incomong.
we back boyz.
STRENGTH CARRIES.
Razor wasn't popular because he countered them. He was a pusher with aghs.
Somewhere around the massive EXP swing.
Ok so lets make some predictions. I think that one of the reasons troll and jugg got so popular is because razor, a hero that was popular before, countered them but then got nerfed. What heros do sniper, troll and jugg counter who will be popular after they all get nerfed?.
It was this game, http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1394525120.
Fv isn't a great manfighter outside of chrono. But yes this is the phase s&y skadi meta.
I hope I'm describing it right, I can find the game.
Sounds hilarious..
Yeah no debate troll needs nerf. I'd like to watch that moment you're referencing..
Yeah, its kinda nuts.
That's too strong.
My point is even with BkB and 25% miss chance, troll can perma stun a farmed carry with no help or good items.
especially without a MKB.
Bash doesn't give a shit about your items if you just stand there trying to hit him.
That I once was crushing as faceless, Daedalus, molihnir, BkB, mask of madness. 1 on 1 against troll who only had MoM and HoD. I was a few levels up. I popped BkB and fought him and got crushed. I was too mad.
I can see it.
it gives the illusion of a chance.
and to me getting obnoxiously slwoed is worse than a stun.
because of the meta skadi is always in games.
but actually it's the amount of slow.
meh..
the fact that I only have fun in AD now.
Whats the most annoying thing about this patch?.

Murfreesboro, not an apartment of sin. Well maybe both.

Fine, living in an apartment of sin.
And moving to Murfreesboro, where we know no one there.

Clinkz ult is so dang good. Only 10 seconds of down time.
you were probably better off with clinkz? still a sweet chunk of damage, and because it's base damage the venge aura amped it.

I think silencer is easier to deal with than sniper IMO.
I think it all depends on the game. Against silencer every channeled ability sucks.
Chono aoe not much bigger.
Sniper always sits back so its hard to get him in the BH. If you get the rest of his team he sjust sits back and rekts you.
With this new sniper meta enigma kind of sucks.
Signs point to yes.
Is BH best #magic8.
But I'd put black hole at #2.
I argue that chrono is better based on its aoe and how void functions.
Is black hole the best spell in the game?.
I'm following now.
-pushes up bridge of glasses-.
The dagon obviously doesnt.
I think he meant that bloodrage pierces spell immunity.
Yeah woody.
Get a job.
Dagon pierces spell immunity? My puck games disagree.
Hawrry sheet.
(and pierces spell immunity).
1.96 * dagon damage ez.
the timing is hard but the damage is stupid.
Bloodrage yourself, bloodrage target, use dagon, ez kill.
shit it is still a thing.

#gif ermahgerd.
Dagon blademail bs used to be a thkng.
"does it work on x?" "yes, it works on x".
all damage.
(yes brain it does work).
Ok just show me what you mean tonight.
fuck hellbear smashers.
And stacking for your carry makes sense because no one is using the jungle while they are in lane.
as long as they're not fucking hellbear smashers, seeker doesnt have a very hard time past level 2 taking them.
classic brian question.
so bloodrage works on items like dagon right.
Like stacking for sk makes sense because he kills a bunch of camps just as fast as one.
Hearts for everyone.
<3.
in my eyes you are perfect mike.
the difference-maker is that if you haven't finished a camp, you can stack it before the respawn. then you don't have to run to a new camp to keep farming, which wastes time.
Thats what i thought but i could be wrong.
Stacking only makes sense if you want to take out a large amount of creeps at the same time with aoe. And bs either a) cant take out all those creeps fast enough for it to be efficient or b) can clear all the camps in the allotted time and therefore stacking doesnt make sense.
i'm not perfect at it, but i can show you the idea.
I will watch.
Ok.
you do not.
ill show you tonight.
You also get fucked by ranged creeps.
aghs refrsher zeus ulti w bloodrage = new glowballs.
Hardly worth it though since it doesnt really save you time in the beginning.
you just have to choke-point right.
Pretty much, still a good combo.
you can absolutely stack jungle and take it early with seeker.
fuck zeus using ulty would be like a starter's pistol for bloodseeker.
Yeah you dont want to do that until later.
ZOOM BITCHES.
it was more difficult.
s&y and euls bloodseeker best bloodseeker.
i made the mistakes of stacking the jungle with him though as a jungler.
Ive made a huge mistake.
hello darkness my old friend.
k. i'll play more bloodseeker. that was fun last time..
That would kill anyone.
Holy fuck.
Jon play more seeker.
lol refresher + aghs + bloodseeker lina is 2660 damage.
Thats stupid..
EVERYTHING.
Bloodraged tinker with et spirit nearby.
Or can it amp all magic damage too.
Can it only do the bloodrage on lina's ult with aghs cause its pure?.
bloodrage my tinker.
(it still works on zeus just 1/2 bonus damage, so only a huge 20% boost).
Before they nerfed it some.
Yeah thats why people used to do zeus bs.
I didnt know that shit worked w other peoples spells.
Free lunches only available during deliberations not during trial.
Did you guys know that Blood seekers bloodrage put on aghs lina amps the damage of that by 40%.
you get shit for pay tho.
Can I be in the jury, but only really want to be there for the free lunches.

Where is the cool spinning gif?.
Yeah they are. Chicago is still probably my favorite song by him.
But 'say yes to Michigan " and "Illinois" are pretty accessible I thought.
Lol yeah age of adz is super inaccessible.
its my first time listening to his most recent album. its very solid. probably the most accessible album he's had for me..
gotta love being sad!.

Judge: now send in the dancing lobsters .
Bailiff "lol k".
Judge: "can we get someone to double check those "like" numbers please".
"or a rough translation, 75 instagram likes".
"Your honour, the defendant merely mistook his iPad for his glock. I mean, who among us has not done that once or twice? And when the defendant went to take a selfie with the victim, he unwillingly shot him in the head as he was taking what he thought would be a fun photo that would get like 30 likes on Facebook.".
Zeus is pretty ez ganks .
Also lina in general is hilarious. Easiest ganks of my life.
"Objection: nuh uh".
This is my favorite part: in which he was seen holding an object that prosecutors said was a Glock pistol. His defense team said it was an iPad..
Just read the Hernandez thing too.
should basically kill anyone except really tanky cores.
1900 pure damage.
yea.
aghs too?.
refresher lina is hilarious.
If anyone gives a shit.
Sry I missed the lawyer question. Basically for possession of stuff you can be found guilty circumstantially so you don't have to actually posses it. Like Andy said if you had something else that links you to the possession. Also prior bad act or crimes can't be introduced bc basically he's on trial for that murder. If the prosecutors said well he shot some other guy. Jury automatically thinks well he's a violent gun shooting dude. Guilty. And that's not what the framers wanted. O'Doyle rules!.
best is if the frost bounces back to ancients after killing so the trap is still there.
Also remember that.
i know i got one kill with it once, and they were super confused on the other team.
thats hilarious.
I remember that.
i _think_ that the one time I managed to farm aghs (offlich ftw) and did that to the enemy ancients, their WK immediately DC'd.
farm aghs > find other teams ancient stack > ez farm denial.
farm aghs > sick stacks > ez farm.
arteezy lich.
blink for maximum space creation.
PPD antimage.
also i think because of how balanced dota is, it would only work in a pro game if you picked which player had to play which hero.
i remember when we did that shit. it was fun, i think i was ET.
i'd love to see a reverse-captain's draft pro game.
No, white moustache and fake suit.
not sure why but it sounds pretty funny.
also wear a white suit and fake moustache.
Andy pls use that in your future trials.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is my client guilty? probably? can he beat the charges? probably not. but can you beat the taste of cinnamon toast crunch? i submit that you cannot.
Best onion headline.
Lesh DC'd. Is 4v5 a throw?.
 http://www.theonion.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-supreme-court-rules,998/.
I would totally shill for a brand for money. I don't have strong enough morals to care.
Mike has c9 thrown that game yet?.
"The court rules your friend didn't deserve to be shot but it was hella funny so you're innocent".
I would include sponsored messages in my rulings.
"and that mountain dew totally rocks".
"The court rules that your friend was totally being a dick and deserved to be shot".
Do lawyers ever try the, "Did you not not not murder him?".
"i am not a crook".
Life in jail with no parole. .
Past acts arent admissible to prove character in most situations unless the guy testified saying "im very non violent".
and wanted to roleply.
or was pirate-kin.
maybe the friend really deserved it.
Also apparently Hernandez once shot a friend in the face which caused him to lose one of his eyes however this wasn't admissible in court. Seems hyper relavant..
yea.
He was found guilty of the murder too right?.
Bullets.
Go!.
How can both of those be true?.
However the same article reports the gun used in the murder was never recovered.
Hernandez was found guilty of illegally possessing the handgun used in the crime.
Law question (Andy/Brian).
Thx Paula.
they havent wombo combo'd. will update if they do.
I can see how ET and BMs ults work together..
So, do they use Riki's smoke to set up the stuns?.

Slardar counters brood so hard.
also: tinker.
but both are unfun.
i'd rather play against techies than brood because brood is more aggressive earlygame.
then you just need to check for remotes.
send a spiderling forward to disarm bombs.
i doubt it.
Techies is a good brood counter.
playing against brood can be really frustrating but its still more bearable than going against techies.
was your nightmare that game last night.
i've had nightmares that are not unsimilar to the way in which i die to broods spiderlings.
spawn-spiderlings given culling blade effect, also global.
andy auto-DC'd from game when brood is picked.

New Dota 2 Update is out. MoM nerfed. http://blog.dota2.com/2015/14/sprint-update/.
i just have to make janky versions.
that looks sweet. i dont have enough cards to copy these kind of decks though.
its fun being able to steal the other sides minons.
and i played some good games against both aggro hunter warlock and ultra control warrior and freeze giant alex mage.
i like recombob preist the best i think.
Just ban silencer nub.
yeah i get some good cards that way.
true.
its very susceptible to silence .
priest is fun though, i like thoughtsteal a lot.
smart.
i spread the buffs.
yeah i assume you usually just get some huge impossible to remove minion by turn 3 or 4.
the zombie chows stalkers and the death lords with the valens chosen and power word shield are so strong early game.
1 owl too.
i run two belchers two zombie chow no sylvannas no healbot no dark cultist only one nova.
it honestly looks pretty standard for a priest deck except with 2 lightbombs, and the gilbin stalkers. i assume its really strong against aggro. what changes did you make?.
my brain is struggling to compile.
or did you just stick with trying to make exodia.
did you include your blue eyes white dragon this time.
but this gives you the main idea.
i made a few changes to it.
http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/savjzs-season-12-lightbomb-control-priest/.

andy been having success on ladder with a priest deck put together by savjz .

And can be done fast enough to avoid reaction times.
The slow from the auto att after ball lightning with the passive will slow enough to still electric vortex the enemy.
Brian the one thing in the combo with his abilities the video forgets is to attack click on the target after ball lightning the passive procs off that and the guide tells you to pretty much waste that right click and immediately electric vortex.
Just keeping busy at work.

On Friday we made Mario and Mushroom out of cans of Mushroom soup (and others).
also because he's making jokes about "like a baus".
And with the new bloodstone recipe it makes soul ring a key item.
You can see from this video that its a few years old.
idk i never play him, but i feel entitled to tell you exactly how to play him.
this build seems a little outdated. it says treads + wand+ 2x null tally. most of them do treads bottle then (soul ring to orchid to bloodstone), or just rush bloodstone.
Storm can clear stacks like a boss and it speeds up the timing on his first item (be it orchid or bloodstone).
Farm faster.
most builds recently skip vortex for a super long time now, not entirely sure why.
And I will try it out tn.

its not pronounced eleven-seas.
elevenses.

#gif elevensies.
yeah so still in the scope of a 2600 calorie day, a 900-1000 calorie chipotle lunch really isnt a big deal i think.
Everything else is just a tease.
Supper is best meal.
I like the food but my schedule doesnt allow for it.
"what do we always say is the most important thing?" "breakfast?" "no, family".
breakfast is the king of meals.
And even then i think thats probably lunch.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/giphygifs/media/p4pqDFU3zIQWQ/giphy.gif.
Unless im doing drunk brunch i never have breakfast.
#gif second breakfast.
lol.
11sies.
and elevenses?.
How about 2nd breakfast.
Rarely will I have time to make a breakfast. Its a quick granola bar if anything.
Or a hobit?.
i mean was my lunch 2 pop tarts? yes.
What am i amish?.
Who eats breakfast?.
we came up with words for them.
breakfast lunch dinner?.
Whats weird about 2 meals.
wat.
2 meals a day.
Which is one of the many reasons why i get the bowl.
> whl eats 2 meals a day.
the tortilla is 300 calories, which is the difference.
So i still say that the place is not unhealthy.
Yeah ^.
similar to what happens when people eat more when they work out cause they think they deserve the reward so they end up gaining weight.
Still is probably fine if all you're considering is your caloric intake of the day.
The calories depend on your order. 625 is a normal meal for someone whl eats 2 meals a day.
go fuck yourselves, commies.
yeah by unhealthy i meant a ton of calories.
Christ. Heart disease in a bowl..
i'm not saying i'm not a fat person in waiting, nor am i super aggressive about eating healthy. in fact, i'm likely to eat that later today. but its delicious..
625 for mine because i'm not a dummy.
1000 calories?!.
50 grams of proteins for mad gainz.
1065 calories in my regular burrito.
http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/menu/nutrition_calculator/nutrition_calculator.aspx.
Type in your ingredients you just did.
http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/menu/nutrition_calculator/nutrition_calculator.aspx.
Explain.
it... is.
Its not medicine but as far as food goes its not bad.
but it's tasty enough that i can eat the guilt away.
Yeah by no means is it healthy.
i mean its not that healthy.
The quality of ingredients is very high.
Im still curious why dragos thinks its unhealthy.
If I get a bowl I always get chips and just murder it like nachos. .
cheese and you're done.
chili powder + meat + peppers.
how? its hella easy.
And whenever i make mexican food and forget it i have regrets.
mmm.
then you just take a mouthful of warm cream.
except when it pools at the bottom.
Its solid.
Yeah sour cream and cheese are necessary. The sour cream is just the best..
Bowl -> white rice -> pinto -> chicken -> mild -> medium -> sour cream -> cheese.
brown rice + fajita veggies + chicken + mild salsa + medium salsa + cheese + sour cream.
fucking die matt.
As far as I know Chiptole doesn't exist in Atlantic Canada, so I've never had it. Is it like taco bell? That shit is poison..
Ill add those in every so often.
bitch do you even fajita veggies.
Not even unhealthy if you dont get the chips.
Burrito -> Brown Rice -> Black beans -> Steak -> Mild salsa -> Hot salsa -> Sour Cream.
therefore you are bad.
you implied its bad.
just overpriced and unhealthy.
i didnt say its bad .
You're dumb though dragos. Chipotle is good.
Oh.
I have never tried it..
The barbacoa?.
barbacoa.
Are you thinking of the right place?.
ill put up your picture at every chipotle across the globe.
They dont even have shrewded beef i dont think.
nope. no going back now dragos. I now forbid you for ever getting it.
i do like their shredded beef though.
YOU'RE UNHEALTHY.
just as unhealthy.
DRAGOS.
> ass what.
overpriced fast food.
LOL matt are you stupid?.
I've never been.
ass what im saying..
fuck i love chipotle.
A country of me's would make Chipotle the top grossing company.
non toxic glue of course.
No Dragos. Bad..
you know what to use as adhesive right?.
"dear delilah, i hate your guts".
lol k fine. tomorrow. .

Jon pls mail that letter..

what would a country full of ultra hetero jonny g's do without girls.
"Alright everyone, back in the pile!".

> what hell.
> would scild.
scold*.
i think the jonny g's would scild each other.
That place would be magical.
only if there's a bunch of dragos' there .
That sounds like hell.
i wanna visit a country inhabited by jonny g's ; i bet ill see lots of song merriment and scolding over poor dota picks.
If I see one dude duplicating himself I'll send a snapchat.

however maybe estonians are just one dude multiplying through division .
as far as i know there are estonian girls out there  so sun is the one who fucked up.

I want a cool Earthshakers totem / wall. Willing to give up any items for one. .
In true lina fashion, but then we rekt him.
rest of his team did very little.
he rekt us early game.
He wasn't even good..
because its a boring item.
and that guy never built aghs.
lol.
Get a job.
Mike was it you that I played that game with against the guy who has like 3500 Lina games?.
never fall off.
phase euls aghs skadi mkb daedalus.
If you can get through the mid game she falls off pretty hard thougg.
100% of the time worth it.
except that phase + euls + aghs makes her a miserable bitch in the midgame.
but a lot of times aghs is still worth it.
i like building rightclick on her.
i kinda hate that its good.
god fk her aghs ulty.
not much more challenging than it already can be for l-dawg.
trying to lasthit lane creeps would be challenging.
thats basically how clockwerk rocket feels sometimes.
deso first item, skip boots.
rightclick towers.
you could also rat from base.
and the ez jungling.
just sit in base and harass all lanes.
can you imagine the lane harass.
projectile speed takes forever.
yes.
would that actually be broken?.

Always takes you by surprise.
but classic r.r. martin.
i was surprised by that part in the book.
But isn't it crazy when Tyrion meets up with Arya and then he impregnates her and Daario shows up for the abortion but arya turns in to her direwolf and gets teleported to the wall where she eats all the white walkers and her and Jon Snow raise Tyrions and hers child for the rest of the series?!.
we'll see though i guess.
but it looks like they may have cut out one of the big characters from book 5 based on last episode.
Yeah I'm gonna keep this spoiler free.
Hope so, way better than old Sansa .
also careful about spoliers.
i think there's gonna be some departures.
Book 6 gonna fuck some shit up. Also its interesting how Sansas story in the book has caught up to it in the show. Does this mean we'll be seeing new sansa storyline?.
Also has anyone thought of getting Dish's Sling TV option, cause it sounds amazing.
Me.

Who here has read the books?.
Treant Protector = Hodor.
Book 6. She'll probably become riki then..
She's not one of the Faceless Men yet..

so you pick 2 4 positions.
jon im not fucking anyone right now.
4, but the way it works is that you pick 2 support 3 core.
you're all fucking dorks.
That would be a dope pick.
This has gone too far.
4 I think.
is aui pos 4 or 5?.
SumaiL would be a sweet pick.
more farm.
get aui instead.
ppd is always 10th in networth.
PPD wins games, ez points.
wat.
never draft ppd.
and he'd get ROTK.
then we'd laugh.
Black^ first pick.
and andy's computer would crash but he'd have strong opinions about who he wants.
Obviously. .
the saddest part about the fantasy draft for TI5 is that ive probably watched enough dota to actually make an informed opinion about who i'd draft.
Where thou feeling it.

and it started playing the clip out loud.
In class and I tried to look up the art thou feeling it now mr. krabs.
Guys, Brian's dad looks very confused..
Guys, Andy's frozen again..
LOL.
Especially if we were all dressed up and on video with each other.
that in fact could actually beat it.
Can we pls do another draft guys?.
Except for a skype D&D session.
Still is. Not much can touch a fucking fantasy draft for professional video game players.
still think we should organize a skype D&D session.
Everyone agreed.
Remember when we did our dota fantasy draft? I remember there was a point during the Skype call that Stu (I think) said, "So, uh, is this the nerdiest thing that everyone here has done?" .
Peanut Butter and Jealous.
Peanut butter and Jelly.
U jelly.
You guys managed to merge two mega nerdy things.
We are cool guys..
Yes PL is a good call.
or phantom lancer.
Or that guy could be meepo.
That moment where the nightswatch guys hold the gate against the giant is like two supports taking on a fed carry..
Him or pugna.
Rubick is one of those guys from the Temple of the Dead who stole Dani's dragons.
Watches people walk away, hooks them in and tortures them with knives .
Pudge maybe. Because he does weird shit to people.
My favorite character in the whole series is Sam Tarley.
He's banned.
I don't like him.
meepo.
Can't think of anyone that would be Ramsay Bolton .
Kotl is that old dude who is really a boss.
Undying is a white walker.
Ned fed first blood.
Denearys gotta be like cm. and Phoenix Jakiro and viper follow her.
RIP.
Kahl Drogo is axe.
The mountain is Sven .
Because he's the one who sees the future.
That other dude with him would be.
welp I'm wrong.

wouldn't bran be oracle?.
Neat!.
Or with a helm of the dominator.
K deal.
Fine. Bran is Alchemist in ability draft with the lone druid bear .
Jamie would be omni or jug.
Bran is apparently half the hero pool.
No Bran is alch! He rides on hodor.
Man loris is fucking awesome.
Bran is Lone Druid .
Lol.
Isn't that the gayboy.
:(.
Loris Tyrell is Invoker .
Rob is lycan.
Hodor is ogre magi.
Bran is chen.
Davos had to go to the bank to pitch that if you let the antimage farm, it could indeed become the one true king of dota .
Brienne is legion.
littlefinger is techies.
Davos is kunka.
Stannis is antimage.
Lina is the fire priestess .
Egret windrunner.
Alchemist is the hound .
Axe is the mountain .
arya is TA.
If dota was game of thrones, what heroes would be who.
And thrones .
Game of who can get away with the greediest line-up .
Rekt.
Jungler + solo support Pudge .
Also that line up was so crazy greedy.
Brain did support Pudge too yesterday. Saved my life so many times 10/10.
Also, 3 - 0 with support pudge.

#gif clippy.
which is more in both cases than you do with daedelous.
and 828 when you do.
with armlet and small crit, you do 473 damage when you dont crit.
i bet he doesn't even use pivot tables.
yeah, the numbers are undeniable.
bet you he has the paperclip help tool open.
andy is a whiz at making brackets. like, rainmain-level whiz at brackets. shit is like fractal complexity.
i can send spreadsheet later.
i am using excel.
Andy Esposito: math whiz.
i bet you're using excel, plebian.
which is still cheaper than daedelous.
ight now doing math for small crit and armlet together.
l2spell nerd.
kidding I LOVE ANDY.
i know, i was comparing it to daedelous in what i was just talking about.
thats one to many people mike.
that song is super sarcastic. "andy you're a start... in nobody's eyes but mine".
i''m the man i'm the man.
jon you can tell everybody.
Andy, Armlet costs 2500 and Crystalys costs 2150..
andy is no star. andy is no man..
jon why.
andy, this is america. this is a democracy. you can say all you want about science and numbers and math, but the rest of us can watch nascar, call you gay, and vote you out of office.
mike retract that last music video.
and continue building your heros wrong.
so suck it nerds.
so you guys can hate all you want, but i was right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQtXxgAAXEk.
yeah but can it see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch.
less than half the price.
for an item that costs way less.
110 more expected damge.
armlet does 443 damage every time.
didntreadlol dot gif.
this means an expected damge of 332.
crit chance is 25%.
so here are the results: with daedelous a level 16 earthshaker does 246 damage without crit and 591 damage when he crits.
http://i.imgur.com/75dta.gif.
and you could make ample use of #haters here.
Also Andy, you're still wrong.
andy. I thought we went over this..
Everyone would have to donate a TP to a teammate. And you'd have to steal one from the enemy team.
alright, math finished, armlet is way better item.
That would take some serious coordination.
i think dagon is the rich man's insult, and soul ring is the poor man's insult.
what about 6 tps not stacked?.
an entire team of 6 slotted soul ring recipes is a dream i want to fulfill .
soul ring recipe is cheapest, refresher is most expensive.
so they know.
but no dagon.
5 dagon recipes.
Null talismans? Bracers? Magic Wands?.
dagon.
What is the most disrespectful recipe?.
Full inventory of aghs.
and we've been looking for ways to innovate in that department.
About time..
to be honest tho a full inventory of recipes is hella disrespectful.
cant argue with that logic, i should just stop doing math.
god be more wrong andy.
See andy..
We're talking about a videogame, so no it isn't..
You may rely on it.
Are 6 armlet recipes better than an armlet? #magic8.
> Relax, you're doing fine.
this is more than ones and zeros.
what hell?.
fuck you sun.
rofl.
It is decidedly so.
Is Andy wrong? #magic8.
numbers indeed.
andy whatchu got there numbers?.
>what hell.
mr. armlet comes back into play.
doing the math right now, btw. armlet costs about as much as the small crit, and even when you do get a crit on that (20%) you still do less damage than you would do with armlet every time you enchant.
what hell.
yes.
sun will i like basically any message that says what hell #yesorno.

I don't think I believe you Kevin..
I didn't know that... But can you give the rapier back to your teammate?.
the rapier has to go to the other team before it is a big ol skanky whore rapier.
just Jons.
yes. your ally dies with newly-purchased rapier. you pick it up. muted.
Rapiers can't be muted, right?.
and 6 muted rapiers in stash.
6 muted gg branches.
^.
6 armlet recipies.
6 dusts and 5 more in the stash before armlet.
*5 gems and one aegis.
5 wards and one aegis.
and one shared tango.
5 sets of tangos before armlet.
No boots duh.
or no boots?.
no blink.
5 bracers before armlet.
also more consistant than straight crit.
the cheapest way to get a lot of that is armlet.
kevin makes a good point though, earthshakers enchant totem benefits from base damage.
So can it, Kevin..
yes.
Is it related sUN? #yesorno.
wholly different beasts.
thats not related. tuskar gets a crit, shaker gets a buff to base damage.
http://i.imgur.com/SLVAdhd.png.
related.
#dulynoted.
Jon has a point.
soul ring into blink then nothing else matters cause earthshaker roolz.
similar playstyle/itemization to kunkka.
not MoM on critshaker. he's not there to manfight, he's there to explode you.
i dont have time to get into this now, because i'm at work but later i will give better thought out reasons why all of you are dumb.
I'd go basher over armlet.
I'd probably even go MoM over armlet.
shaker farms slow. have to pick the right order of items to not waste time.
every day of the week too matt.
you'd be wrong.
 Id go deso over armlet any day of the week.
and armlet is one of the most cost effective damge items in the game.
i maen i'm not saying daeldelous is bad but we're comparing different tier items.
+40 * 4, but daedalus is better.
I don't think armlet is the right pick on him.
Crit + enchant totem or whatever its called is waaaay more damage.
+40.
it buffs his damage so much.
fast blink and then armlet.
Armlet takes a while to farm.
Seriously though, critshaker needs a fast blink and then deadalus.
#rekt.
r-e-k-t rekt rekt rekt.
I still maintain you're a doofus.
yet no one who plays that hero ever believes me.
i still maintain that armlet is the correct item on critshaker.
but critshaker gets more damage from +STR to crit with?.
Extra damage is spose. Although I think the extra mana from treads would be more useful.
jon curious why you went phase boots on critshaker.

We can talk about it over Skype next time we're both on.
just as reliable as foursquare.
Because it gives them a "hunting journal" so to speak. Hunters love talking about the amount of stuff they shoot, and this would give them a super accurate record of their hunting endeavours.
Real talk, $200k maybe? Why would any hunter use it though?.
unsanitary diapers?.

Seriously though, I feel like if you pitched this to the North American waterfowl Management Plan team you might get money for this. They have 100s of millions of USD.
also if the app works in europe, why wouldnt it work in america.

How much money you got?.
@Woody Zantzinger . Serious talk here. At the conference, one of the Europeans mentioned they're developing an app so that hunters can track immediately when they shoot a bird, what species it is, and it takes their GPS locations. This would start to create a huuuge dataset on harvest records for waterfowl in Europe. How hard would an analogous app be to create for North America / USA? I can see something like this being huge for conservation.

Turbotax is only free for 1040a and 1040eZ. I'm on the 1040. Where's you Schedule B son. What you know about taxes.
Yeah figure out how much you get paid hourly. Then figure out how much time you'd save using software. Boom, easy calculation of how much to spend.

I don't think I'll ever claim my time is money. Most likely I'm spending that time fart with my pants off. That shit is worthless .

I agree actually.

Its like 100F here every day and the orchards are on bust and I live in a huge winery area.
Is she hurting you?.

why are you marrying that huss then.

Michael Desrosiers changed name to Woody Zantzinger 2.
That's not nice. .
Hey Jon. Fuck you.
Matt how long are you hanging out with vikings .
neat.
Its a rainy day. I'm on my way home. Gonna pick up sushi and a hot and sour soup and watch Game of Thrones season 4 to prep for Sunday .
for =longer than you think/want.
because it stays in you.
you do.
Ugh you'd feel so inestimably foul after all those nugz.
I've eaten 50 chicken nuggets. It sucked. Greasy sponges.
grey sweats.
and jon is sweats.
*.
sweaty nugz.
loser wears a dunce cap for the rest of the day.
even cranking up the heat to full blast would suffice. wear two heavy winter coats. get a 50 piece chicken nugget.
that idea is fucking hilarious. I want to do it..
am i remembering wrong, or was the name sweaty nugs?.
i still dont understand why that was ever an idea.
Hot Nugs was a dream of madmen, no living man has ever attempted the challenge. .
I played a game with Hobbes where the loser of each hole of golf had to wear a heavy winter jacket the whole time until they won a hole. Hot summer days and losing two holes in a row was debilitating.
zete is back apparently.
and tried to eat tons of fucking nuggets.
where you dressed in winter coats in a hot car.
How about that McNuggets game that you played woody and stu.
thats a softball for jokes.
That's like an instant way to pickle yourself.
when life gives ya soy sauce.
welp.
zeta psi or die is what you were thinking of mike.
Zete .
kappa psi or die.
annie's brothers old frat right?.
I think they're back now? I dunno.
it was shut down i thought.

i got to slap dollar bills on ones ass actually while she was going down on another stripper.
but thats all i have.
and another time one picked a 5 dollar bill off my face with her vagina.
i got jerked off by a stripper.
I'm pretty sure teddy had a war or two because of that.
You wont.
i long for the day someone in our generation becomes president and we start a war because the vice president says, "you wont".
Imagine if they took venmo or those square card transactions .
Cash works better with strippers.
Classic Eric..
peer pressure best pressure.
We did. I regret nothing.
Dragos pls respond.
is dragos a black guy in nawlinz.
dragos.
that was a happy man.
i did enjoy the one guy who was super super super into butts and just had the girl waggling it in his face while he just tossed billz at it.
Disclaimer: woody and Eric made me do everything that happened to me with strippers.
andy had some better experiences with that 'temptations' strip club but i don't think they were too wild.
Pls tell me you went to the clinic after Jon.
The whipped cream was a part of the strawberry. It was multipart.
Vivid smells.
Tied to pole for birthday. Strippers used me as pole..
no.
Did he sUN? #yesorno.

I didn't do that.
Licked out of butthole?.
ok im appeased on strip club stories.

Whipped cream.
Ate the candy.
The drilldo was for the crowd.
Picked up with vag.
Strawberry candy on nose.
Guys wtf.

Fucked a stripper.

Fucking huge..

#sunstrike.
your mom.
What's the dirtiest thing you've ever done?.
I once laid on the stage with a fin in my mouth and a stripped did the splits over me and grabbed it with her vadge.
i'm imagining you just sort of "teehee"-ing to yourself while doing it.
I was entertained..
Last time I was in a strip club I got to ball up dollar bills and use them as balls to shoot at a strippers vagina that she had a cup under..
also andy is wrong about the "little if any nudity". literally no nudity. i may as well have just picked up a victoria's secret catalog, but the special edition about looking really sad while nearly naked.
strippers are best with kind eyes. these had the opposite of kind eyes..
And also make me fall asleep.
Strip clubs make me sad.
like there was no soul left in the strippers. if thats the case, dark stuff andy, dark stuff..
define dead eyes..
place was sketchy.
lots of huka.
little if any nudity.
dead eyes.
were the milkshakes in the yard ass.
Why was that strip club so disappointing when we parted ways that night andy and mike.
Also it was foie gras, not any kind of butt.
Hearts all around.
Classis Eric.
shit was hilarious..
and then got boo'd by people walking by.
Also remember when Eric puked in that tree.

i didnt know it was foie gras.

duck liver tho.

it wasn't duck anus..

remember that duck anus i ate in NOLA.

axe dont seem like a pot head; more like a meth head.
Also snoop dog is in Cville this weekend. I'm positive if we go the "tea bazzar " we will find him.

BIRD LAW WHUDDUP.
Maritime Law for me.
*at this point in time.
i mean i'm basically an expert on bird law at this reason.
Also i'm talking out of my ass.
I think the defense for the bomber is trying to claim it was heavy influence of his brother who died. So the jury has to decide what the influence and aid probably was.
he does these on the nyc subway between stops.
my drawing instructor.
good work, jury..
>The second question was about the difference between aiding and 
abetting. The judge said aiding and abetting is a single concept, and 
that to aid and abet is to help someone intentionally commit a criminal 
offense. .
I dunno what i would do with a lifetime sentence in jail.
that drawing looks very amateurish.
i think he just has too much time on his hands so he can put a lot of wffort into trimming his beard.
He looks he's wearing one of those furry KGB hats.
also that artist made dzhohkar look evil as shit in that picture. devilishly-pointed facial hair and all.
im guessing they sketch the general shapes in the moment, then go back and color in it real detailed later.
Guessing, but im sure time is a factor so accuracy is more important than artistic representation .
Fried chicken.
I'm pretty sure he's gonna get fried .
Apparently they showed a picture of the bomber planting his bag next to a small child, paused to hear testimony from dead child's parents, showed video of bomb going off next to child then showed autopsy photos. .
why are courtroom artists only mediocre artists and why do they always use dry pastels.
http://iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/chatroulette-cleaning-shoe-cleaning-plate-looks-slightly-dodgey-cam-14183430580.gif?id=506.
i think ordinarily that would just be stalking.
in my photo class we learned about a guy that just followed a stranger around france for a week taking her picture.
God damn it thats good. Im imagining dragos furiously drawing in a tree .
you can get away with that.
its art.
So if I peeping tom a girls window, its OK as long as I draw a picture and not take a photograph.

I also guessed south america on the eastern european.
One of my favorite procrastination games.
That geoguessr quiz was fun.
yeah, i was really convinced that was brazil.
You and I both guessed south america on an eastern Europe.
"this road sure looks woodsy, i'm gonna say canada. No it was russia? ok fair enough game.".
haha, also a legit strat when there are no clues whatsoever.
I was just balls out guessing.
you basically explore til you see a sign or flag or something.
oh yeah thats huge.
Oh you can actually go down the roads? No wonder I'm getting smoked I thought you had to stay in one place.
Yeah Andy, thanks for nothing.
alright one more: https://geoguessr.com/challenge/Kp4dSIHXyvQPUAjP.
Damn wp.
and then i just guessed the biggest city and got lucky.
gotta look for details.
there was a chile flag.
damn andy how the fuck did you guess south america. you won the round soley on how fucking close you were there. south korea was a bad guess.
they buffed rift mana cost. i think you can cast 3x at level 1.
mike.

4 dazzles and AA. perma grave.
Haha man, chilling touch then blink blow someone up.
i think i once was able to get force staff and blink dagger on qop. 10/10 fun.
4 anti mages and AA. Lots of blinking and slamming .
can't perma disrupt.
whats the duration and cd?.
The amount of poison flying through the air.
with infinite mana could you keep him perma disrupted?.
first team to kill the other AA wins.
AA and 4 Shadow demons.
AA is glass too.
probably CM.
i kind of want to figure out an inhouse that has a "protect the x". idk how we'd make it work. what's the slowest, most fragile hero?.
yes.
ok so you do a round then send the challenge, got it.
i'll do it and send it to you.
how do we start another round.
fun though, right?.
yeah.
i think you won by a little, that one in like norway was confusing as dick.

Jon and Matt and dragos don't much care for in house. We tried 3v3 ability draft last night and it went ok.
I think we now have 10 Dota players. Can we plan an in-house 5v5? Pick captains and draft the team then the heroes? When is everyone free to play dota?.

if the answer is more than 0 you are an awful parent.
i feel like the second one is actually a pretty good benchmark.
"How many of my children were taken by ghosts".
I don't think "how quickly did my children discovery pornography" is the best benchmark for quality of parenting.
summary: i would be a terrible parent.
and thats how my kids will discover porn.
if i ever have kids, once they turn 8 i'm just gonna say "never ask me a question you haven't googled first".
thats how like 99% of questions can be answered.
We actually did help that guy. We googled "How to kill Willow trees" and sent him the top result.
Did you get to help kill willow trees.
alright, i guess if you ever decide to execute some app idea i have to agree by default to be a partner only to not risk being the guy who misses out on being a billionaire .
"Hi, how do we kill willow trees? When tree trimers cut down trees they used a greenish powder kind of stuff to kill the willow stump. Do you know what it is and where we can but it? Thanks".
Best inquiry we've ever had (this is a quote).
he had regrets.
lol.
I met someone who passed on being the 3rd partner for Instagram. Thought it was stupid.
Like most things, it is almost never the idea which makes something successful. Its the details in the execution. Most ideas suck when they are pitched.
because for me, most of the popular apps, if you pitched them to me in a vacuum sound stupid.
very very few.
also, how good are you guys at actually distinguishing good ideas from bad ones? do you ever make apps you think are a shitty idea but they end up being successful?.
how many legitimately good app ideas do you get that dont get made because the person cant afford it?.
I can pull some awesome customer reviews, I think we save them in a list somewhere. Also amazing app ideas people send us.
and she is basically an app.
Well I guess it isn't.
boom, sun knows.
you guys must have great customer service reviews.
no.
sUN, is it user error #yesorno.
no I checked, user error.
false. it says message didnt send (i have no idea why, i had service) and then it just tries to resend the message over and over until it succeeds. it does not give me the option to not send the message once i have already sent it through another medium (my computer). thats not user error, thats poor design.
As someone who works in apps, I can say it is 100% user error.
my phone doesnt send shit until like an hour later sometimes.
goddamnit.
Zeus, np, axe.
but didn't get the model size change TB normally gets, so it was just a teeny-tiny metamorph dazzul wrecking face.
i watched that game. loved the enemy dazzul who got god's strength, metamorphisis, and terrorblade's illusion thingy.
basically you created troll.

I had riki ult w/ fiends grip. While I ulted, Brian had bounty hunter with WR ult. It was hilarious.

ability draft is an exercise in embracing insanity.
allow me to submit this game as evidence for my claim: http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/964058438.
I've come to enjoy ability draft.
single draft tho.
i have strictly mixed feelings on least played.
and also the most fun.
Fuck you jon.
least played is the easiest game mode.
Not my fault I shat on them Ez kid gg rodlskates.
7.) That was a Least Played game.

2.) It was a 3 v. 3
3.) That game doesn't count.
totally worth the nearly 6k gold.
phase shift + radiance is so next level. ez 162.5 damage and they can't even hurt you.
No. Rushed Dagon eblade. Didn't even blink or Euls .

should i quit playing games with it?.
yeah what about that andy.
How can I trust you when you're so reckless with my heart..
also makes it impossible for techies to drop his items to abuse soul ring or mana boots.
bounty is amazing as shit against techies. dude can just follow around the techies and note where the mines are, trust me i've seen it done in a bunch of games.
ez.
Disclosure: Brian is playing a puck game with two abandons on both sides. Gonna inflate the numbers.
i dont agree with axe or bounty lol.
techies is only effective if he's off the enemy vision.
also bounty is really good.
he's tanky enough that most early mine stacks dont kill him.
Axe??.
and yeah ta is good too.
zeus, np, axe.
Yeah what hell brian.
yo fuck brian.
Srsly tho TA isn't half bad. Also Zeus and like sniper to destroy them.
4v5 Andy abandons.
lets say someone first picks Techies in an AP match. Who is the perfect Anti-techies team to draft in reponse?.
Yeah that picture was nearly incoherent really.

also i think we've offically lost every other person in the chat.
jamie really screwed the pooch though.
i think i pulled my end of the bargain pretty well- abused substances with scooby.
we split up and i nailed daphne.
wait, we've done that already. how'd it work out for you.
jenkies gang.
because obviously i want that.
...is that a thing?.
do you really want the additional challenge of a scooby-doo episode every time you try to hook up with a girl.
that sounds painful.
not the reverse corkscrew thing though.
ducks got it figured out.
yeah in retrospect, step up your game human females.
That would be a good thing andy.
and store pickled fish.
or secret compartments in their vaginas to avoid getting pregnant.
but what if finnish ladies have reverse-corkscrew genitalia to compensate.
Boom.
duck sex is hilarious.
Andy knows his duck anatomy.
matt pls.
bonus points if your penis corkscrews.
skankynavian girls?.
"what do me and a duck have in common? We're both sexually aggressive and have disproportionately large genetailia".
i don't have any more puns for that.
also back to matt picking up hot finnish bitches.
yes ?.

i want to afford it, but i dont have any money.
if you have to ask, you're not old enough for it.
is that like, a sex thing? whats the cherry?.

dragos lost me.

the ones that trap you in when you go bobbing for cherries .
honest hips as they are known today.
i'm assuming they were into 'birthing hips', but i have no idea what those are.
those big burly dudes liked their chicks  tall and skinny; they were ahead of their times.

sUN, are any of these girls gonna let matt over the finnish line #yesorno.
"we'll steal you, you, you, not you, fuck no not you, annnnnnnnd you.".

the reason scandanavian woman are attractive is because vikings had good taste.

http://i.imgur.com/qIJB5.gif.
#kobe how many cute finnish girls has matt checked out already?.
as long as you have a sap to take the fall for you.
or maybe hallucinogens to commune with nature and truly be one with the duck .
.........
one wrong move and you have yourself a sticky situation.
a maple syrup heist is pretty risky.
What's in Finland ? .

and y'all got your maple syrup stolen in a huge heist anyways.
we have vermont for that.
What about all matters concerning maple syrup and other maple products?.
i bet theres gonna be so much weed at matts conference.
I haven't seen it either.
on all other matters, great scrutiny is to be applied to canucks.
only because we're discussing hockey.

he's canadian.
and you know you can trust matts opinion.

because ducks fly together.

still though narrative songs like the ones on their ealy albums are pretty awesome.

but they fell victim to the annoying labmate.
i used to think the decmbrists were the shiiit.
apparently he has a grudge against the black keys for 'stealing' his style, lol.

I should probably list to more of his stuff.
he's prob a douche but he sings good.

Game 5 secret asus polar!.
They're classified as metal, but only because rock has become diluted over the years.
Yea.
my ears say sty's question is right. 'technically' metal but i dont see them eating bats onstage live.
Technically?.
lol apparently if you search anything on youtube today, it asks if you want "darude - sandstorm".
Are they metal? I've never listened .
Shit rocks.
My favorite song is 'tread lightly' by mastodon right now.
Iron and Wine is the shit.

"hey jon, if you were silencer, what you be doing right now?".
LOL.
hahaha when dragos had to politely ask jon to STFU.
never stop jon; tell me how to play aa.
I agree. That's basically what she was saying. .
One talks mostly, other listens mostly. Obviously nothing crazy but just in general .
i think your mom just wanted to tell you to shut up.
How about this one, my mom told me there can only be one talker in a relationship. She said this cause I like to talk a lot and she's like, you should stop that. .
Also neither of us are really music people so it doesn't matter. .
love triangle.
Erika and I don't like the same music.
Sucks.
she then proceeded to break up with me to go back to dating her ex, who was also my lab partner.
i briefly dated a shitty girl who had similar taste in music to me. would not reccomen..
right now im listening to made in heights on repeat.

Meh.

really nice butt.
she actually is pretty hot; .
That means she wasn't hot.
i tried; she fought back with her annoying personality; she won.
You should like her more, not the music less.
i wonder if this happened to any of you; i work with this girl that i find annoying but she likes all themusic i like and plays it in the lab which ruined it for me; cant enjoy it anymore.
dragons pls.
Dragos your turn .
remix to ignition is mrs. zantzinger's favorite song.
Maybe remix to ignition or clarity.
I like andys stuff.
Yeah I knew Andy's was going to be one of those .
or maybe ms. hill by talib kweli.
probably something by lupe fiasco like daydreamin or dumb it down.
i think, at last check, the song i had played the most on itunes was "your ex-lover is dead" by stars.
(you're surrounded by hipsters).
I haven't hear of  of these.
what if your favorite song was seriously "ms new booty".
song enjoyment is so dependent on the mood and state of mind youre in that i find it hard to think there is one that covers everything.
Ats a good song too.
Shampoo Suicide by Broken Social Scene.
Somebody by Jeremiah natalie la rose.
ats a good song.
My favorite .
Simple song by the shins.
which doesnt really make any sense.

I think undy is the worst hero in dota.
Kidding I might. .
Decep your mothers undy's cause no one wants to touch that shit.
Decrep your stupid face.
Your mothers undy's.
No. Decrep the tombstone. So it can't be killed.
Or warlock undy.
CM undy better combo.
There are way better slows than decrep.
Pugna + undy lane. Decrep tombstone.
Jon w8 4 me.
Getting on in 5.
Nobody's online :(.
#now.
Also pugnas lore is awesome.
DAZZUL.
k, I agree.
mike may be right, but we should still check.
goes back to the dazzle thing.
also, i think we should have established by now that dota is a weird game and reading the wiki doesnt answer questions.
"most friendly effects such as healing and teleport are unaffected by invulnerability".
http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Keeper_of_the_Light.
http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Invulnerability.
it heals for 75% of 500 i think'.
also invulnerable doesnt necesarily mean the heal wont work we shold still try just in case.
I think armlet is one.
items.
jugg.
for sure.
jugg.
wd?.
need 1 more.
So LC huskar chen warlock.
he's right, OD counts as invulnerable.
Our internet is down at work so I'm all group chat right meoa.
because it would heal more than lc.
idk if mike is right on that one and i think we should check.
k yea.
Can't be hit.
OD is off map in astral.
does illuminate heal in astral?.
what about kotl?.
no.

But can you use tether.
Io banned too before anyone suggests.
I keep forgetting the rules after I read.
god dmanit.
Read rulea.
Phx banned.
4% max hp per second.
Also forgot about urn.
waht about sun ray?.
Meecro.
Drop item, eat tango, pick up item.
Tango, lol. .
Bottle urn mek salve are probably the only useful items on allies.
wasn't speicified on merlini's page btu probably in comments.
I know you can use in fountain, but i figured it would be less than a scythe would be so i was wondering if it made more sense to grab rune or be in fountain.
k.
No enemies.
Can't have another team.
use two abiltiies?.
an you have an aghs rubick.
so this is perfect meecro.
wait.
Works then.
Can wait for regen rune to expire.
Its while od is imprisoned.
One hero can pop cheese for that instant 2500 hp lol.
You cant activate it though.
You don't have to choose between rrgen rune and fountain. Can bottle and use IN fountain.
Guys lol cheese was not restricted btw.
WW no BC you can't astral self.
100 health per second.
What does more regen rune or fountain?.
Regen rune? Would that matter on od? Or does it do less than other items.
I hadnt thought of bottle, but just one.
or just one bottle possible?.
also everyone has bottle.
WW woudlnt work?.
mek and pipe and headdress don't stack.
Oh didn't read all the rules.
Oracle banned.
Btw was wyvern or oracles increase to healing thought of by anyone???.
you need 6 items on OD.
Someone needs a mek, a pipe, and a headdress.
you would just explain aghs on chen.
ooh okay you dont need to list items on allies.
Many things are outright forbidden.
forgot.
oh it is.
Read merlinis rules pls.
Bloodstone against the rules i think.
does it heal?.
while OD is astral.
if an ally dies with bloodstone.
Ok, so chen has an ancient golem, and a satyr meaning he has an aghs as well. His heal is a burst heal for 400.
decrep does nothing.
no pugna, ult doesnt work on astralled hero.
to use heal.
slash e blade on an ally.
ult and/or would decrep help?.
(yes).
also what about pugna?.
52 --> 37 or something.
not sure if this was mentioned but stolen int decreases during astral.
Fuck you warlock.
Ok, thats the 5th then i guess.
Fuck i keep forgetting about lc.
legion is 60 heal/s.
probably.
Doesnt go through i assume.
pugna butt pump.
And woody is right, halfway through he'd lose one int stack.
And imprisonment duration is 4sec.
Alright so unless someone thinks of another hero those are the 5.
Yeah sounds like it.
Od int = 26 + 3.3*25.
warlock winz.
tree's second heal does not go through astral.
voodoo = 40/s, armor = 13/s, shadow word = 45/s.
Also tree has two heals, but do the leech seed pulses go through astral?.
My guess is wd, but idk for sure.
Who heals most: wd, tree, warlock?.
For now, who is the 5th hero though?.
105 int + 6 * 35 int from sheeps is 325 int, + 13 * 4 astral steal = 377 int.
Yeah we have to basically solve it for a few different combos.
fuck you math.
or go skadis to get more HP and also get a good amount of int for regen.
i guess you start having to balance how many hearts to max out HP, vs how many sheeps to max regen.
So if 6 scythes get you to full, then it might be better to throw in a heart.
The other thing is seeing how much hp od has with the items. Hearts will give you a higher cap if you can get close to it.
but the int will expire in Astral, which effects huskars heal (it auto updates).
some math is about to get hard, OD can use astral 4 times before the 1st INT steal expires.
can't you just stack sheeps then and huskar's heal will eclipse everything else?.
So we have to do the math, with huskar heal and heart heal is it better to have 6 hearts, 1 heart and 5 sythe or 1 heart and 5 skadi.
And skadi gives 25 of each.
Vs 30 for shivas.
35.
Nvm its sheep.
not sheep?.
Let me check.
Shivas gives most int i think.
hearts do not stack but you get more heals for having more having more health.
let me know if that link is working for you.
does heart healing stack?.
so he just has to pick them up.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18TmimSohagbGnq47JHh9NARn7ECKdfdulDqcjD_DUes/edit?usp=sharing.
I think so.
wait can you pickup heart and have it be off cooldown like tranquils?.
...from enemy heros?.
At least one heart definitely. But then calculate the tradeoff between more int and more strength.
"under sustained fire".
Heart would be on Cooldown, its a bad buy.
And we may have to adjust his items from 6 hearts to some skadis or int items.
Assume max stolen int on od.
We need one more.
+ 160.
So jugg huskar and chen are the definitely in ones.
it is 1280% of primary attribute.
Oh holy shit, so definitely huskar.
setting up a google spreadsheet for teamwork.....
I didnt either, one sec.
because huskar sucks in 99% of drafts and games.
I didn't realize Huskar worked like that.
Like fountain or heart it doesnt make sense to drop items.
so assume he has max stolen and tons of Int items.
Percent it doesnt help.
Huskar's heal is better based on Intellgince on OD?.
Like bottle.
so you can have cake and eat it too.
"Unlocks the regenerative power of a friendly unit, with healing based upon its primary attribute.".
Only foe set regen.
woah.
i think its like dropping items for regen, generally goes faster.
If you could time the ticks right for the number based heals you could move it back and forth.
neither does your mom.
But that doesnt max percent heals.
move golem in at last second.
Mana and Health regeneration provided by the fountains is 4% maximum HP 
or Mana per second plus an additional 14 Mana points per second..
Whats the best way to use the golem though? Have it in range the whole time to max the percent based heals, or move it away and then back to maximize set number heals.
http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/30y1ky/od_theorycrafting_puzzle_2x_arcana_to_the_winner/.
Isn't it obvious? Pudge fountain hook back to your own fountain..
yeah, why not.
also in the comments from the reddit post, merlini mentioned fountian regen is possible?.
And chen's heal probably is probably good too.
people also were discussing armlet.
that would be OP as fuk.
damn.
Doesnt stack.
doesnt stack.
you oculd even bring in 3.
ancient golem is smart smart smart.
There arent that many.
bring in ancient golem.
The items arent an issue.
I was thinking possibly chen.
assuming perfect meecro.
and swap right before STACHE.
and you can technically have more than 6.
also they are lvl 25 and each hero gets any 6 items.
http://www.merlinidota.com/content/puzzles/odstache/.
(I don't know what we're talking about).
enchy doesnt do astra.
Dp ult doesnt work.
DP ult heals dp, dummy.
DP ult.
Idk if mek does it might.
kotl aghs won't hit in astral i bet.
someone who can load dota can check.
Kotl aghs.
Do the butterfly things go through astral?.
enchantress.
Obviously jugg because percent based.
Goddamnit. Alright now we have to figure out which 4 does the most.
legion.
treant but i dont think his heals much.
Anyone wanna do the math?.
Alright, so the team is od, huskar, jugg, wd, warlock.
Warlock.
The only heals over time i can think of that are targeted would be huskars and wynter wyvern.
Like if you target him first and then the heal hits.
Idk if necros thing goes through od imprisonment.
And wd.
Jugg aura also.
Big satyr creep also gives aura health regen so you would want a dominated creep or doom.
Items that give health auras: pipe, headdress, mek.
Regen from multiple HoT do not stack, but you still might want more than one to increase the percentage based heal from the item.
Sty: the answer is -1, its a trick question. No one can escape Axe's dunk.
Also secret and vp polar playing bo5 now.

k sounds good.
you're fucked no matter what you do.
so dont worry.
and stu, if law school has taught me anything its that anyone can be sued for anything no matter what.
no :horse:.
try to sit thru this.

also she is like chief counsel for the beer institute (http://www.beerinstitute.org/).
obviously.
cus she knows better than to mix weed and alcohol.
best part is that she actually never even drinks at all.
"going to see my aunt mary jane this weekend".
I just don't want to get sued.
mike, you have friends who've thought you were way cooler than you were.
I don't care if the university gets sued.
you're not jon. you can't use cooldog.
i have an aunt whose name is "Mary Jane". so we call her aunt mary jane. it has taken me 24 years to finally find this hilarious.
Can you ever have sex with someone who is mute and illiterate because they can't give consent? 1 in 4 didn't cover this very relevant edge case.
you won't.
but yes.
so it's less of a gift and more of a paper insult.
no, because I know they're a bitch.
would it be reasonable to expect that they will use it?.
or use it for bartering.
hey could give it to someone else if they wanted.
I figured that I'm not forcing them to assume the risk of skydiving, because it's just a gift certificate.
they have to sign anyway to skydive.
then they are a waver.
they'll sign a waiver at the skydiving place.
they just have to wave AT you.
have them sign a waiver.
are you getting at the doctrine of respondient superior?.
'acting'.
I'm acting as an employee of UTK.

actually I have a real life law question .

Do police need a search warrant for things you hide in your butt? A Butt Warrant if you will?.
police didnt come yet.
Well mike, bob was just drunk, he wasnt really in trouble.
Just submit the song as your memorandum.
So shame on him now.
write an objective memorandum about all possible claims and defenses. kthxbye.
shame on him.
Jon should have known Bob was trouble when he walked in.
and then you have like 30 things to write about.
its not "can jon sue bob?" its name all the claims and possible defenses.
my mistake, please fill it in.
brian you're forgetting the best part of the questions.
The classic assumption of the risk defense.
Jon knew the risk when he alked by.
Yes. Ez mid.
its like bob hit mike in the face bc he was drunk and mike is a little bitch, then mike had a heat attack and shit himself, Jon alked by and slipped on the shit and slipped and broke his pelvic bone. Can Jon sue Bob?.
Sample Torts questions are the best.
So does my boss.
Law school fact patterns throw a lot of unimportant facts in the questions to try and throw you off.
Wait did Joe strike the tree using the car, or mike?.
Andy's ready.
He's right..
then no.
Oak.
what kind of tree?.
I'm helping practice!.
Both Joe and Mike are injured. Does Mary's auto insurance cover them?.
Mary and Joe are divorced and share custody of their Son Mike. Joe borrows Mary's car to take Mike to a baseball game but arrived visibly intoxicated. Mary ignores this fact and still lends Joe the car and he hits a tree with the son..
This is why Andy is in Law School.
e) when someone cant handle the truth.
d) always.
c) when you should.
b) sometimes.
a) never.

you think we can commit to this? i'm pulled a lot of directions. i should really checkout the differences..

then i better git going.
yea.
ah, i need to do the git side of things.
Accept Stu's change, push new code. Bam!.
No. I just updated the GroupMe and Heroku side of things.
did you accept the pull requests? is that what you did?.
I did that already, just need you to push the new bot to Heroku.
i'll push the updates but i can't really debug it today.
doesn't some work need to be done on heroku or something to hook it up to the API? i thought we had to specify what URL to point the bot at the make it work.
and Yes.
Yes.
also does anyone else use slack? our new IT guy wants us using it but it just had a huge security breach, about which i lol'd.
is working theory that if i accept the pull requests sUNbot will be operational again?.
